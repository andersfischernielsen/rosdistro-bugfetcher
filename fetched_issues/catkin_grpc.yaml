  title: 'Unable to include headers found in devel/include, generated by grpc'
  body: "I have a project (let's call it parrot_common_wrapper) that uses grpc to generate headers from protobuf.  protobufs are found in parrot_common_wrapper/parrot-common/tctm/, and an example of a protobuf is Echo.pb. These headers are then installed into devel/include in the root directory, no further subdirectories. I can see this myself.\r\n\r\nI have another project (let's call it parrot_comm) in which I would like to include these generated headers, but for the life of me I couldn't get it to work. It simply could not find the requested header file. I have tried the following to include it:\r\n\r\n    #include \"Echo.pb.h\"\r\n    #include \"tctm/Echo.pb.h\"\r\n    #include \"parrot_common/tctm/Echo.pb.h\"\r\n    #include \"parrot_common_wrapper/Echo.pb.h\" \r\n    #include \"parrot_common_wrapper/parrot-common/tctm/Echo.pb.h\"\r\n\r\nBut none of these work, all giving me the same error: that the file is not found\r\n\r\nHere is my CMakeLists for parrot_comm:\r\n\r\n    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)\r\n    project(parrot_comm)\r\n    \r\n    find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS\r\n      roscpp\r\n      grpc\r\n      std_msgs\r\n      parrot_common_wrapper\r\n    )\r\n    \r\n    catkin_package(\r\n    \t#  INCLUDE_DIRS include\r\n    \t# LIBRARIES parrot_common_wrapper ${ALL_PROTOBUF_LIBS}\r\n      CATKIN_DEPENDS roscpp std_msgs parrot_common_wrapper\r\n    #  DEPENDS system_lib\r\n    )\r\n    \r\n    include_directories(\r\n    \t#include\r\n      ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}\r\n    )\r\n    \r\n    add_executable(parrot_comm src/parrot_comm.cpp)\r\n    \r\n    target_link_libraries(parrot_comm ${catkin_LIBRARIES} parrot_common_wrapper)\r\n\r\nAnd here is the CMakeLists for the parrot_common_wrapper project\r\n\r\n```\r\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)\r\nproject(parrot_common_wrapper)\r\n\r\nfind_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS\r\n  grpc\r\n  roscpp\r\n)\r\n\r\ncatkin_package(\r\n#  INCLUDE_DIRS include\r\n LIBRARIES parrot_common_wrapper\r\n#  CATKIN_DEPENDS grpc roscpp\r\n#  DEPENDS system_lib\r\n)\r\n\r\nset(TCTM_DIR ./parrot-common/tctm)\r\n\r\ninclude_directories(\r\n# include\r\n  ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}\r\n)\r\n\r\ngenerate_proto(parrot_common_wrapper SRC_BASE ${TCTM_DIR} FILES \r\n\t${TCTM_DIR}/Subsystem.proto\r\n\t${TCTM_DIR}/Echo.proto\r\n\t${TCTM_DIR}/Telemetry.proto\r\n\t${TCTM_DIR}/Telecommand.proto\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat am I missing? I'm sorry if this is a very trivial problem, I've been dragging my hair out for a whole day trying to fix this."

  title: Some fix to grpc package.
  body: "- Use HTTP/HTTPS download instead of git to speed up downloading. This should fix #7 \r\n- Move the headers to private location so that the new protobuf version will not conflict with system default.\r\n- Force embed all third_party dependencies to ensure portability.\r\n- Force static linking on libprotobuf"

  title: Make the headers to private locations
  body: >-
    Some packages depend on older version of protobuf will find the new version
    headers here. We should only expose these headers to those packages who
    depends on "grpc" package.

  title: Python Runtime Dependency
  body: >-
    Ideally in "run_depend" section there should be `python-grpcio`, so that
    generated files will have Python runtime support automatically. However,
    there is no such deb package available, and we could only install it via
    `pip install grpcio`.
