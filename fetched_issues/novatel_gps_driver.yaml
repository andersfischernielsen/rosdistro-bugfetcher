  title: Feature select serial baud rate
  body: "For the serial connections one may want to connect to the device in a baud rate other than 115200. This PR adds an option for the user to set the desired serial baud rate.\r\n\r\nI had to add the `NovatelGps::SetSerialBaud(...)` method to allow setting the baud rate without changing the signature of `NovatelGps::Connect(...)`.\r\n\r\nThis is only important when connecting through the device serial ports. It seems to be irrelevant if you're using the device USB port, that emulates a serial connection behind the scenes but apparently handles the baud rate for you.\r\n\r\nTested with a OEM6 GPS."

  title: Insufficient data rate is logged for GPS rates lower than 20 Hz
  body: >-
    A user reported seeing this message logged when using an OEM718D device that
    was running at 5 Hz.  Looking at the code, I suspect that this warning will
    be logged any time GPS messages are received at a rate of less than 20 Hz,
    even if the `polling_period` is configured differently.

  title: Binary BESTPOS log with a Position Type of "74" causes a crash
  body: >-
    One of the unit tests is crashing because it's trying to parse a binary
    BESTPOS log that has a position type of "74".  That's out of bounds of the
    POSITION_TYPES array; judging from the documentation here, the array in the
    driver needs to be updated:

  title: >-
    GPS stops publishing if bestpos messages are too far behind GPGGA and GPRMC
    messages
  body: >-
    The novatel driver tries to sync messages of our 3 selected message types
    (GPGGA, GPRMC and BESTPOS), before outputting a current /localization/gps
    measurement. However, if the BESTPOS is 1 or more seconds older than the
    other two messages, no gps will be output because the buffer is only 1
    second long.
