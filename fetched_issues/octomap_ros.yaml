  title: Add build dep on cmake_modules
  body: "The cmake module shipped with the octomap package uses absolute paths\r\nthat break cross-compilation builds and require additional tweaking\r\n(e.g. see https://github.com/bmwcarit/meta-ros/blob/43bd17e8839f4078351895eca361804f19efb13c/recipes-ros/octomap-ros/octomap-ros_0.4.0.bb#L16)\r\n\r\nThis patch makes octomap_ros use the cmake module provided by ROS's\r\ncmake_modules package to avoid such tweaks.\r\n\r\nThe patch depends on https://github.com/ros/cmake_modules/pull/43"
