  title: Get invaild mode error when using uvc_get_stream_ctrl_format_size
  body: "I have a uvc camera and try to do some image processing work on its stream. I am working under ubuntu 16.04. All works fine if I use opencv to open the device. Since I'd like to open the device through the vid and pid, I try to use libuvc to get the video stream.\r\nSo I tried the test.c in libuvc and get the following output:\r\n\r\nDevice opened\r\n[device.c:871/uvc_claim_if] claiming interface 0\r\n[device.c:880] end uvc_claim_if (0)\r\n[device.c:326/uvc_open] libusb_submit_transfer() = 0\r\n[device.c:343] end uvc_open (0)\r\n[device.c:481] begin uvc_get_device_descriptor\r\n[device.c:523] end uvc_get_device_descriptor (0)\r\nDEVICE CONFIGURATION (1234:0101/[none]) ---\r\n[device.c:535] begin uvc_free_device_descriptor\r\n[device.c:548] end uvc_free_device_descriptor\r\nStatus: idle\r\nVideoControl:\r\n\tbcdUVC: 0x0100\r\nVideoStreaming(1):\r\n\tbEndpointAddress: 0\r\n\tFormats:\r\nEND DEVICE CONFIGURATION\r\nbmHint: 0000\r\nbFormatIndex: 0\r\nbFrameIndex: 0\r\ndwFrameInterval: 0\r\nwKeyFrameRate: 0\r\nwPFrameRate: 0\r\nwCompQuality: 0\r\nwCompWindowSize: 0\r\nwDelay: 4720\r\ndwMaxVideoFrameSize: 0\r\ndwMaxPayloadTransferSize: 4198000\r\nbInterfaceNumber: 253\r\nget_mode: Invalid mode (-51)\r\n\r\nIn test.c I only change the vid and pid in uvc_find_device and the width and height of the frame and fps in uvc_get_stream_ctrl_format_size. My device support 1280*960@15fps and 1280*720@10fps. I have tried both resolutions and get the same invaild mode error.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something important?\r\n\r\n"

  title: Building with jpeg support
  body: >
    I am building and extending _libuvc_ros_ which depends on _libuvc_. I can
    get _libuvc_ to compile and install, when configuring with cmake it even
    says it is "Building libuvc with JPEG support.". However when I want to use
    the libraries function _uvc_mjpeg2rgb_ it complains it is not defined. This
    makes sense since in the header LIBUVC_HAS_JPEG is not defined. How can this
    be fixed so that LIBUVC_HAS_JPEG is defined and the function _uvc_mjpeg2rgb_
    can be called?
