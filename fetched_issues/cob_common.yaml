  title: '[cob_drive_wheel] fix physics for gazebo - base drifting'
  body: "as mentioned and observed by @ipa-pfs both `cob` and `raw` are spinning when simulated in gazebo although no command is sent, i.e .they start spinning right after being spawned\r\n\r\nthis seems to be a physics (inertia, friction) problem of the base, most likely the `drive_wheel` model, as it can be observed that:\r\n - no command is sent by `cob_omni_drive_controller`\r\n - wheels are not oriented towards the observed motion\r\n - not all wheels are rotating/moving (check frames in rviz and gazebo in wireframe view)"

  body: "this PR copies `schunk_lwa4p_extended` description from `schunk_description` to `cob4_arm` in `cob_description`\r\n\r\nthis allows `cob_robots` to get rid of the dependency to `schunk_description`.\r\n`schunk_lwa4p_extended` isn't a schunk product anyway...it's cob4-specific\r\n\r\nI decided to keep `schunk_lwa4p_extended` in `schunk_description` as it is used in `schunk_robots`, e.g. by @ipa-bfb "
