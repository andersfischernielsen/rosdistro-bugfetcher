  title: 'Fatal error: tuw_geometry/measurement.h: No such file or directory'
  body: "Hello Dr Markus. Recently I'm trying to run your another package \"tuw_marker_slam\", it can't locate the tuw_maker_slam_node (even if the node is declared in CMakeList by \"add_executable\"). After my own checking, I guess the issue happens on tuw_marker_slam 's dependency, tuw_geometry. When I was installing tuw_geometry, it gave a fatal error saying \"tuw_geometry/measurement.h: No such file or directory\".\r\n![measurement h](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33207488/51598839-46cae180-1ef6-11e9-8506-e8b7b9b4fbf6.png)\r\n\r\nI thought I missed something. It's surprising that I found there is indeed no such a file in this github repository! This could mean that one file corrupts tuw_geometry, and therefore corrupts tuw_marker_filter ??\r\n\r\nI think what you did in your master thesis with these packages were (and are) excellent. It successfully visualizes how the EKF works. I hope your work won't be crippled by such a minor issue. Could you tell me what should we do? Thanks a lot for your help!\r\n"
