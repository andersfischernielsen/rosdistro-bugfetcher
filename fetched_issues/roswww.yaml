  title: Utilize test_depend that is defined in REP-140
  body: >
    Looks like using `test_depend` is more appropriate than build_depend, after
    [REP-140](http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0140.html) got [implemented for Groovy
    and
    later](http://lists.ros.org/lurker/message/20141003.232955.5710a2bf.da.html).

    Confirmed with de2d9e00e96932d1da4178900fc7fee021dc63f7 on Indigo, Trusty


    Error description updated:


    `$ rosrun roswww webserver.py` then accessing http://localhost:8000 doesn't
    return (web browser keeps trying on and on). When I kill webserver.py's
    process, browser immediately shows "server not found", so I assume the
    browser is able to connect to the webserver (webserver log file might help
    here..).

  title: Propose to update roswww as webserver without ros_comm dependency
  body: >
    I was looking into `roswww` implementation to utilise as webserver which
    does not bring any ros_comm related dependencies.


    The following was requiring ros dependency in roswww

    - Logger(rospy.loginfo,logwarn...) 

    - rosparam for port parameterization

    - rospack shell command

    - tornado


    I would like to propose changes to keep ROS dependency minimal in roswww

    - Logger - It would not necessary to ros logger since it is webserver.
    Rather to use stdio or python logger

    - rosparam - replaceable with command line argument.

    - rospack shell command - It is necessary. [rospack
    dependency](https://github.com/ros/rospack/blob/indigo-devel/package.xml#L18-L30)
    should not be a problem. It is pure C++ module which does not bring ros_comm

    - tornado - I have proposed to separated out tornado from rosbridge_server.
    https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite/pull/147


    Then roswww package will only depend on

    - rosbridge_tools : for tornado

    - rospack : for package crawl script

    roswww should depend on rosbridge_tools rather than rosbridge_server.

    tornado is soon to be in rosbridge_tools package.  #146  #147 #149

    They both contain tornado and it is installed by both. Just install the two
    packages to reproduce.
