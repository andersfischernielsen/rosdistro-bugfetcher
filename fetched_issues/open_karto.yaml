  title: Added proper Boost dep export
  body: >
    Without using a ROS handle, linking fails for the karto library since karto
    requires Boost and has been depending on roscpp to provide the needed linker
    flags. Adding a proper Boost export allows it to be compiled against in
    programs that does not instantiate ROS handle objects.
