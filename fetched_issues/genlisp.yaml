  title: Missing dependencies when generating services
  body: >
    There seems to be a bug related to the asd-file generation. When you
    generate multiple services that depend on different message-packages, only
    the dependencies of the last compiled service is added to the asd-file.


    You can see this bug in action in this repository:
    https://github.com/phyrog/genlisp_bug

    Just catkin_make it and inspect the generated asd-file. "geometry_msgs" and
    "std_msgs" should both be listed as dependencies, but only one is listed,
    depending on which service was generated last.
