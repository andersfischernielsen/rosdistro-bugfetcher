  title: 'Handle angle wrapping to address #43'
  body: "Shouldn't depend on \"angles\" package because it is not part of ROS core\r\nmetapackage so we don't want that dependency in tutorials. However, I figured\r\nthat the relevant methods are well-tested and stable to it made sense to use\r\nthem."

  title: Angle wrapping in draw_square.cpp
  body: "Now that [this commit](https://github.com/ros/ros_tutorials/commit/b1f84c4902a1263381b83f7c41cca5cdc3f918dc) has been merged, the turtlesim is guaranteed for its pose to always be in [-pi, pi). However, when [checking if the turtle has reached its goal](https://github.com/ros/ros_tutorials/blob/821a8ae33c6da1a70e21453392f6980380f670f8/turtlesim/tutorials/draw_square.cpp#L29-L32), a simple `fabs` is used. This results in the turtle never being able to complete its square as reported in [this answers.ros.org question](https://answers.ros.org/question/292653/turtlesims-draw_square-only-draws-34-of-the-square-like-_-and-then-it-spins-forever/).\r\n\r\nA very easy fix was to include [angles](http://wiki.ros.org/angles) as a dependency and then use `angles::shortest_angular_distance`. If we are okay with modifying dependencies for this package, then I'd happily open a PR from [my fork](https://github.com/jarvisschultz/ros_tutorials/commit/9e6575fdaae59b637b4b44678d52964ae865b8da). We could, of course, also write a similar function inline if we didn't want to modify dependencies."

  title: Turtlesim /spawn service uses different coordinate system
  body: >
    The numbers used when spawning a turtle via the `/spawn` service are sent
    directly to the `turtlesim::Turtle` constructor in Qt coordinates. All other
    numbers used in the various topics and services are in a different
    coordinate system; e.g., `/turtleX/pose` topics and
    `/turtleX/teleport_absolute` services. What this means is that teleporting a
    turtle to a given (x,y) and spawning a turtle at the same (x,y) will result
    in turtles at two different locations.


    See [this answers.ros.org
    question](http://answers.ros.org/question/211156/question-on-frame-transform/?answer=211208).

  title: turtlesim does not install .svg images
  body: >
    Turtlesim uses both .png and .svg images for turtles (currently the only
    .svg image is "hydro.svg"), but the cmake file only installs the .png
    images. The result of this is that occasionally a spawned turtle will not
    appear on screen.


    In  turtlesim/CMakeLists.txt, the lines


    ``` cmake

    install(DIRECTORY images
      DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_SHARE_DESTINATION}
      FILES_MATCHING PATTERN "*.png")
    ```


    should be changed to 


    ``` cmake

    install(DIRECTORY images
      DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_SHARE_DESTINATION}
      FILES_MATCHING PATTERN "*.png" PATTERN "*.svg")
    ```

  title: Release of version 0.4.0 is missing some commits from groovy-devel

    Probably due to some branch confusion, some commits from 0.3.13 were dropped
    in version 0.4.0. I believe that the commits


    66bd5c8dcb35c50612b5bd26d82e9c1113dae544

    a7de3a75f4df0433186639f113dcd13f45f542f6


    from Dirk Thomas should be rebased to hydro-devel and a new version with
    these commits should be released.


    Especially, commit "check for CATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING" is important for the
    OpenEmbedded integration with meta-ros (github.vom/bmwcarit/meta-ros).
