  title: Added nested subnamespaces and more options to hide or group topics.
  body: "rqt_graph has had a long-standing problem; in real use cases, graphs quickly become unwieldy and unreadable, with dynamic reconfigure's parameter topics everywhere, and don't even start with images. \r\n\r\nThis pull request aims to solve these problems with several changes, including:\r\n\r\n* Added nested subnamespaces. The \"Group Namespaces\" checkbox has been replaced with a spin box, allowing users to enter the number of levels of grouping they desire.\r\n* Grouped topics (such as action topics) now display as 3D boxes.\r\n* Added a checkbox allowing the grouping of topics added by tf2 (from ros/geometry2) (i.e. /tf and /tf_static), in a manner similar to action topics.\r\n* Added a checkbox allowing the hiding of topics added by tf2 (from ros/geometry2) (i.e. /tf and /tf_static).\r\n* Added a checkbox allowing the grouping of topics added by image_transport (from ros-perception/image_common) (i.e. /, /compressed, /theora, and /compressedDepth), in a manner similar to action topics.\r\n* Added a checkbox allowing the hiding of topics added by dynamic_reconfigure (from ros/dynamic_reconfigure) (i.e. /parameter_descriptions and /parameter_updates).\r\n\r\nThese changes, originally implemented in ros-visualization/rqt_graph#9, have been split into six separate commits, with formatting changes removed, for ease of review.\r\n\r\nThese changes are dependent on pull request ros-visualization/qt_gui_core#87.\r\n\r\nNote that the Hide section of the toolbar has been shifted down to a new line, and margins have been changed as the creation of a new line caused spacing problems.\r\n\r\nThree files are attached to this pull request; the launch file I used for testing, a before picture, and an after picture, displaying what rqt_graph looks like before and after the changes.\r\n[Attachments(1).zip](https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_graph/files/1195298/Attachments.1.zip)"

    Multilayer namespace nesting, grouping for tf and image topics, hiding for
    tf and dynamic reconfigure
  body: "rqt_graph has had a long-standing problem; in real use cases, graphs quickly become unwieldy and unreadable, with dynamic reconfigure's parameter topics everywhere, and don't even start with images. This large commit includes a number of feature improvements designed to combat this, listed below:\r\n\r\n* Added nested subnamespaces; the \"Group Namespaces\" checkbox is now a numeric spinbox, which specifies the number of layers of depth desired.\r\n* Allowed the grouping of tf topics (/tf and /tf_static).\r\n* Allowed the hiding of tf topics.\r\n* Allowed the grouping of image topics (<image>/, <image>/compressed, <image>/theora, and <image>/compressedDepth), similar to action topics.\r\n* Allowed the hiding of dynamic reconfigure topics (<node>/parameter_descriptions and <node>/parameter_updates).\r\n* Grouped topics (tf, action topics, and image topics) display as a 3d box when grouped.\r\n* UI changes; reduced some margins, added checkboxes for above options, moved \"Hide\" section to a new line to prevent the interface being too wide.\r\n\r\nThese changes are dependent on pull request ros-visualization/qt_gui_core#87.\r\n\r\nThis pull request resolves issues ros-visualization/rqt_graph#3 and ros-visualization/rqt_graph#4.\r\n\r\nThree files are attached to this pull request; the launch file I used for testing, a before picture, and an after picture, displaying what rqt_graph looks like before and after the changes.\r\n\r\n![before](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4635334/26687158/1916a570-46bd-11e7-8ca6-6978fe6e9d92.png)\r\n![after-2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4635334/26687115/fba236c6-46bc-11e7-90cd-b7ac3cb73a2a.png)\r\n[Attachments.zip](https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_graph/files/1045267/Attachments.zip)"
