  title: Do not ignore robot model on the association stage
  body: "This is important mostly for polygon footprint_model; with current code, almost no obstacles are considered, as with polygon footprint_model min_obstacle_dist is typically very small, possibly equal to footprint padding on costmaps.\r\n\r\nBut could also be that I misinterpreting the code... so in that case feel free to reject this!\r\n\r\nPlease ignore white spaces when comparing, as CLion doesn't like trailing white spaces"

    Straight global plans do not obey 'global_plan_viapoint_sep' nor
    'max_global_plan_lookahead_dist' 
  body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nWhenever I send a straight global plan, TEB doesn't comply with these parameters and generates the whole trajectory to the goal (see the images below). \r\n\r\nThe compliance with these parameters would be important if you want it to follow long trajectories, as TEB fails to compute local trajectories longer than ~75 meters (with my setup).\r\n\r\nGood behavior with a curved trajectory (local costmap in white):\r\n![good](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10373469/42096135-cd277602-7bb4-11e8-884a-40a1a3526a85.png)\r\n\r\nBad behavior with a straight trajectory (local costmap in white):\r\n![bad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10373469/42096134-ccfba1da-7bb4-11e8-87c0-9ab835c60744.png)\r\n\r\nIs there any parameter/workaround to solve this?\r\n\r\nIf not, how easy would it be to fix it and create a parameter to solve this?"

  title: Detect teb convergence problem
  body: "Hi Christoph,\r\n\r\nSometimes, due a different number of factors, teb cannot converge the path to a good solution.\r\nOne very important thing, since in these cases the robot can go anywhere... is to detect that case and stop the cmd vel, like in the unfeasible plan. \r\nI m thinking in analyse the poses generated (eg: if the poses are too distant from each other or a measure of how the angle between multiple poses were selected. \r\nMaybe we can do it in the answer of G2o or in the cost step? \r\nWhat to do think about this functionality?\r\n\r\nThanks for the awesome work!"

  title: Teb planner without a map
  body: "Hi again @croesmann\r\nI have tried to create an empty world and modified the costmap accordingly (I think).  However I am not able to use the 2D Nav Goal in Rviz to get it running. may you take a look and tell me what is wrong?\r\nFirst I tried with no map at all, but apparantly /map topic is expected.

  title: Indigo - Kinetic Synchronization
  body: "I would like to port the current version of the kinetic track back to indigo (and probably jade) due to the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- Faster and simpler cherry-picking of new bug fixes.\r\n- New features and options extend the indigo API mainly without destroying old parameter settings (at least the default setting).\r\n- The kinetic branch seems to be stable (default settings) for quite some time now.\r\n\r\nThe package is a leaf package and hence no other packages are depending on it.\r\nHence I think that we can ignore the policy that new features shouldn't be backported to previous but active LTS distributions this time.\r\n\r\nIf anybody has some doubts regarding this synchronization, please let me know. \r\nI will wait 2-3 days before merging.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nChristoph\r\n"
