  title: Add route messages
  body: >
    Add `RoutePosition` message and include all four new messages in the build
    files:

    - `marti_common_msgs/KeyValue`

    - `marti_nav_msgs/Route`

    - `marti_nav_msgs/RoutePoint`

    - `marti_nav_msgs/RoutePosition`


    Because `marti_nav_msgs` needed more dependencies, I also refactored the
    `CMakeLists.txt` to reduce the redundancy and potential for error.

  title: Create Route and RoutePoint messages
  body: |
    Route and RoutePoint are very general messages to define a sequence of
    achievable poses for a vehicle along with arbitrary metadata about the
    route and the point itself.

    Requires also creating the dependent KeyValue message.
