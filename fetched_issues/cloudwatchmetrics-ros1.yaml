  title: Metrics are published with a timestamp of several minutes in the future
  body: "When processing `MetricList` messages we convert the nanoseconds time on the metrics `time_stamp` to milliseconds incorrectly. Instead of dividing by `1000000` [we divide by `1000`](https://github.com/aws-robotics/cloudwatchmetrics-ros1/blob/ad347e3b847c7ca7738250230025d351f3a91855/cloudwatch_metrics_collector/src/cloudwatch_metrics_collector.cpp#L75). As a result metrics are sent to CloudWatch metrics with a time stamp displaced to the future. \r\n\r\nWe will send a patch to fix this bug to have this fixed in the next two days"
