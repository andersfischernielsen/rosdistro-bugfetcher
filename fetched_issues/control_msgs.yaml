  title: Export architecture_independent flag in package.xml
  body: >
    This package doesn't have any binaries in it, so it can be marked as
    architecture independent.


    Tested on the RPM buildfarm (http://csc.mcs.sdsmt.edu/jenkins/):

    - [x] No regressions

    - [x] No binaries installed


    See:

    - https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/issues/4037

    - https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/bloom/pull/270

    Thanks!
