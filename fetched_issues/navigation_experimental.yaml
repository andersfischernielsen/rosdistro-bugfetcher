  title: 'Pose follower: visualization of global plan added'
  body: "I have added the publishing of the global plan within the pose_follower whose poses the pose_follower follows for visualization purposes. The plan is published on the global_plan topic with the PoseFollower namespace.  Until now pose follower global and local plan topics existed but could not be visualized in RViz. Now a copy of the global planner path that is passed to the pose follower is republished for visualization. Even though some global planners publish the global path for visualization (like global_planner), some like carrot_planner dont so now the pose_follower will always publish the path that it is following not depending on the global planner used.\r\nIt was tested on ROS Kinetic, Ubuntu 16.04 and a Jackal Clearpath robot."

  title: pose_follower package in ROS navigation stack
  body: >
    Hello,


    I am trying to add the pose_follower package as a plugin to the navigation
    stack (ROS Hydro, Ubuntu 12.04). I followed the guide here
    (http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/Writing%20A%20Global%20Path%20Planner%20As%20Plugin%20in%20ROS)
    to do this and everything compiles fine, and the new plugin is available by
    nav_core (rospack plugins --attrib=plugin nav_core), but when I am running
    the navigation, I get the error below:


    [ INFO] [1417068766.032804515]: Using plugin "static_layer"

    Running

     c++filt _ZN18base_local_planner20TrajectoryPlannerROSC1Ev

    outputs


    base_local_planner::TrajectoryPlannerROS::TrajectoryPlannerROS()


    but the issue is base_local_planner exists in my CMakeLists.txt File


    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)

    project(pose_follower)


    find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS

    add_dependencies(pose_follower nav_msgs_gencpp)


    install(FILES blp_plugin.xml

    )


    install(DIRECTORY include/pose_follower

      LIBRARY DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_LIB_DESTINATION}
      RUNTIME DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION}
    )


    I also explicitly added trajectory_planner_ros library to the
    target_link_libraries() (target_link_libraries(pose_follower
    ${catkin_LIBRARIES} trajectory_planner_ros base_local_planner)), but still
    getting the same error


    Any thoughts?
