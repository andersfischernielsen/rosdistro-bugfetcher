  title: Generic version of IPOPT
  body: "Hello \r\nIPOPT comes with a number of interfaces to linear solvers (MUMPS, LAPACK, HSL) and others. \r\nI tried to create a dll of ipopt with none of these solvers in order to focus o Eigen. \r\nthe build fails because it looks for these libs. \r\nIs there a clean version of IPOPT ? i.e., one that does not depend on any solver a priori ?\r\nthen the build of IPOPT+EIGEN could be much cleaner and simpler.\r\nbest\r\njac\r\n\r\n"

  title: Implemented more efficient method for building constraint jacobian
  body: "_coeffRef_ is in comparison to _setFromTriplets_ a quite costly operation.\r\n\r\nTests showed a reduction of computation time with this solution of 30 up to over 50 percent depending on the problem size.\r\n \r\n_setFromTriplets_ also considers multiple entries for the same indices and adds them up, so there is no issue that += in line 137 of composite.cc was used earlier.\r\nFurther details can be found here:\r\nhttps://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__TutorialSparse.html#TutorialSparseFilling"
