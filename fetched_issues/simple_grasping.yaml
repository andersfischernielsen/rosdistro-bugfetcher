  title: add libvtk6-qt-dev dependency to build on Debian Stretch
  body: "the `libpcl-dev` package is missing a dependency causing the `Qt5::Widgets` target to be exported but not satisfied.\r\n\r\nThis should fix the currently failing Stretch builds (e.g. http://build.ros.org/job/Lbin_ds_dS64__simple_grasping__debian_stretch_amd64__binary/1/)"
