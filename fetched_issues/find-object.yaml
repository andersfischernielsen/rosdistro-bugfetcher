  title: buildtool depend on genmsg?
  body: "Looking at the package manifest of this package I noticed that it expresses a `buildtool_depend` on `genmsg` ([here](https://github.com/introlab/find-object/blob/2cb9120f7424d2fba13932dc8755b57acb2814a7/package.xml#L13)).\r\n\r\nThe build script doesn't seem to do anything special wrt messages/services or actions, so I'm wondering whether that dependency is really needed. If it was added to be able to build messages, it should not be needed (`message_runtime` and `message_generation` are responsible pulling in the required dependencies).\r\n"

  title: Unknown interpolation method in function resize
  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nFirst, I want to thank you your work and contribution to the ros community. Second, here are some questions I have regarding the installation of find-object package.\r\n\r\nI installed ros-melodic apt and some other packages from source located in my catkin_ws, like find-object. As far as I undestand, opencv3 is a standard on melodic and the library will be automatically installed as specified on http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Migration#opencv\r\n\r\nThe problem is, I guess, that I also have another opencv version installed (3.4) in /usr/local, which is built with CUDA. Therefore, I see some warning during compilation time:\r\n\r\n> /usr/bin/ld: warning: libopencv_core.so.3.4, needed by /home/nvidia/catkin_ws/devel/lib/libfind_object_2d.so, may conflict with libopencv_core.so.3.2\r\n\r\nAnyway, building find-package from source is so far ok, but as soon as I try to read an image with find_object_2d I'm getting the following error:\r\n\r\n> OpenCV Error: Bad argument (Unknown interpolation method) in resize, file /build/opencv-XDqSFW/opencv-3.2.0+dfsg/modules/imgproc/src/imgwarp.cpp, line 3367\r\n> terminate called after throwing an instance of 'cv::Exception'\r\n>   what():  /build/opencv-XDqSFW/opencv-3.2.0+dfsg/modules/imgproc/src/imgwarp.cpp:3367: error: (-5) Unknown interpolation method in function resize\r\n\r\nIf I install find-object binaries with apt everything is working fine, so I guess there are some conflicts between libraries during compilation from source, isn't it?\r\n\r\nHow should I proceed If I want to be able to build find_object_2d from source but using my own opencv version? Shoudl I uninstall libopencv-dev and rebuild cv_bridge and all its dependencies using opencv 3.4?\r\n\r\n"

  title: Color independent object detection
  body: >
    Hi!

    Your Repo is awesome, i learned a lot about object detection by reading your
    code.


    I am wondering if all descriptors are color dependent. While the logo with
    brown background is getting detected, the one with a black background is
    not: 

    ![color dependent
    detection](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17978263/15985394/c9dad9a6-2feb-11e6-95bc-a418cd02fadc.png)


    I rather want to detect the shape of my logo, than the color contrasts so I
    can detect it in any combination with different backgrounds.


    Is that possible with the detection algorithms used by find-object or will I
    have to use haar cascades for that?


    Thanks,

    manu
