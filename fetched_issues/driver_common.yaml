  title: release driver_common for Jade
  body: |
    It's a dependency for the wge100 driver, and several other things as well.

    I just released diagnostics, so this should be safe to release.

  title: Export architecture_independent flag in package.xml
  body: >
    These packages don't have any binaries in them, so they can be marked as
    architecture independent.


    Tested on the RPM buildfarm (http://csc.mcs.sdsmt.edu/jenkins/):

    - [x] No regressions

    - [x] No binaries installed
