  title: Missing mvsim dependency found in .launch
  body: "I'm currently doing some research on static analysis of ROS packages at the IT University of Copenhagen, more specifically dependency checking of `.launch` files in ROS packages. \r\n\r\nThere seems to be a `$(find mvsim)` in  \r\n- `mrpt_navigation/mrpt_local_obstacles/launch/demo_with_mvsim.launch` \r\n    - that's not declared in `mrpt_local_obstacles/package.xml`\r\n- `mrpt_navigation/mrpt_reactivenav2d/launch/reactive_nav_demo_with_mvsim.launch` \r\n    - that's not declared in `mrpt_reactivenav2d/package.xml`\r\n\r\nInstalling `mrpt_navigation` without having `mvsim` installed would make `roslaunch` fail on these two `.launch` files, right? \r\n\r\nI'm unsure whether this is a dependency bug, since there are only two specific launch configurations using `mvsim` and not the entire package(s). \r\nNonetheless, `roslaunch` would fail, no?

  title: mrpt_reactivenav2d does not generate velocity commands
  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have been trying to launch [mrpt_reactivenav2d](https://github.com/mrpt-ros-pkg/mrpt_navigation/tree/master/mrpt_reactivenav2d) using [stage_ros](https://github.com/ros-gbp/stage-release/tree/release/kinetic/stage) + fake_navigation + map_server. (The reason being, mvsim does not seem to be compatible with MRPT 1.9.9 >= yet) \r\n\r\nSo, every node starts ok, but when I send a goal to the navigator (from a point clicked in rviz) I get an error and navigation is cancelled due to a timeout.\r\n\r\nThese are the tag nodes I think are relevant. My guess is the problem lies in the \".ini\" files in the package itself since stage responds normally to my keyboard commands and the vehicle shape is received by the reactive node without trouble. Note that I am using the config files it provides the repository. Or maybe mvsim plays a role that I am not accounting for.\r\n```xml\r\n\r\n\r\n<node name=\"map_server\" pkg=\"map_server\" type=\"map_server\" args=\"$(arg map_file)\" launch-prefix=\"$(arg launch_prefix)\" />\r\n\r\n<node pkg=\"fake_localization\" type=\"fake_localization\" name=\"fake_localization\" output=\"screen\">\t    \r\n\t    <param name=\"odom_frame_id\" value=\"odom\"/>\r\n\t    <param name=\"global_frame_id\" value=\"/map\"/>\r\n\t    <param name=\"base_frame_id\" value=\"base_link\"/>\r\n</node>\r\n\r\n<node pkg=\"stage_ros\" type=\"stageros\" name=\"stage_ros\" respawn=\"false\" output=\"screen\" args=\"$(arg world_file)\" >\r\n    <param name=\"laser_scan_topic\" value=\"/laser_scan\"/>\r\n    <param name=\"laser_frame_id\" value=\"/laser_stage\" />\r\n    <param name=\"disable_odometry\" value=\"$(arg disable_odometry)\" />  #if true, no topic, neither tf transform are published for odometry\r\n    <param name=\"odom_topic\" value=\"/odom\"/>\r\n    <param name=\"odom_frame_id\" value=\"/odom\" />\r\n</node> \r\n\r\n<node pkg=\"mrpt_local_obstacles\" type=\"mrpt_local_obstacles_node\" name=\"mrpt_local_obstacles_node\" output=\"screen\">\r\n\t\t<param name=\"source_topics_2dscan\" value=\"laser_scan\"/>\r\n\t\t<param name=\"show_gui\" value=\"false\"/>\r\n\t\t<param name=\"time_window\" value=\"60\"/>\r\n</node>\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nI'm publishing the robot shape in a very simple node found here:\r\nhttps://github.com/MariotoA/shape_publisher\r\n-->\r\n<node pkg=\"shape_publisher\" type=\"shape_publisher\" name=\"shape_publisher\" output=\"screen\" launch-prefix=\"xterm -e\"/>\r\n\r\n<node pkg=\"mrpt_reactivenav2d\" type=\"mrpt_reactivenav2d_node\" name=\"mrpt_reactivenav2d_node\" output=\"screen\">\r\n<!-- *Important*: This external config file holds the most important navigation settings --> \r\n\t<param name=\"cfg_file_reactive\" value=\"$(find mrpt_reactivenav2d)/tutorial/reactive2d_config.ini\"/> \r\n\t<!-- This is to allow the reactive responsive to RVIZ GUI commands -->\r\n\t<remap from=\"reactive_nav_goal\" to=\"/move_base_simple/goal\" />\r\n\t<!-- Enable logs to ~/.ros/reactivenav.logs , use navlog-viewer to open them -->\r\n\t<!--<param name=\"save_nav_log\" value=\"true\"/> -->\r\n\t<param name=\"topic_robot_shape\" value=\"/chassis_polygon\" /> \r\n</node>\r\n\r\n<node name=\"rviz_player\" pkg=\"rviz\" type=\"rviz\" args=\"-d $(find tfg_reactive_pkg)/rviz/simbot_reactive_only.rviz\"/>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the error trace itself:\r\n\r\n[ INFO] [1524665257.040733976, 7.600000000]: Nav target received via topic sub: (2.555,1.869, -23.832deg) [frame_id=/map]\r\n[ INFO] [1524665257.041667984, 7.600000000]: [navigateTo] Starting navigation to [2.554826 1.868601 -23.831614]\r\n[MRPT_navigator|INFO |16:07:37.0436] [CAbstractNavigator::navigationStep()] Starting Navigation.

I followed [this](https://www.mrpt.org/MRPT_in_GNU/Linux_repositories) and mrpt/utils does not exist for example) and ros-kinetic. \r\n\r\nAlso, I noticed just now this is the same bug as [this one](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/49772103-mrpt-exception-at-mrpt-math-cruntimecompiledexpression-compile), but I get two navparams for some reason, one being, I assume, the robot pose and the other the goal I send.\r\n\r\nI've emphasized in bold text the parts of the trace that seem suspicious to me. I did not include any map files since I believe the problem does not come from there, but maybe i'm mistaken, just ask if you need them.\r\n\r\nAny idea?

  title: mrpt_reactivenav2d compilation fails after latest mrpt commits
  body: >
    Latest mrpt commits seem to be braking the mrpt_reactivenav2d ROS package. 


    For starters, the mrpt-kinematics library should be included in find_package
    call of the CMakeLists.txt file.

    Below, the error message prior to this is  given below:

    When launching `roslaunch mrpt_localization demo_ro.launch` I get the error
    `librawlog_play.so: cannot open shared object file`.


    There must be a dependency missing. Which package provides
    `librawlog_play.so` under Ubuntu 14.04 with Indigo?
