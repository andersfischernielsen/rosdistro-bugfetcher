  title: opencv3 is not used on travis even OPENCV_VERSION = 3
  body: >
    on debugging at https://github.com/ros-perception/opencv_apps/pull/41, I
    noticed that errors from `opencv3` compatibility occur only on `kinetic`.

    further investigated, and found that `rosinstall_generator` at `.travis.sh`
    downloads only files of metapackages but not files of its dependencies.
