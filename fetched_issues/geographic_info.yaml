  title: Bad UTM Transformation
  body: "Comparing the geodesy and pygeodesy modules:\r\n```\r\nfrom pygeodesy import utm as pyutm\r\nfrom geodesy import utm\r\nlatlon=(-41.0,147.0)\r\npyutm.toUtm(latlon[0],latlon[1]) # [Z:55, H:S, E:500000, N:5461243]\r\nutm.fromLatLong(latlon[0],latlon[1]).toPoint() # x: 500000.0 y: -4538757.06191 z: 0.0\r\n```\r\nEasting seems to be fine, Northing is the problem:\r\n```\r\nlatlon=(-40.0,146.0)\r\npyutm.toUtm(latlon[0],latlon[1]) # [Z:55, H:S, E:414640, N:5571764]\r\nutm.fromLatLong(latlon[0],latlon[1]).toPoint() # x: 414639.538157 y: -4428236.06463 z: 0.0\r\n```\r\nConfirmed that the pygeodesy module is giving correct UTMs according to [geoplaner](https://www.geoplaner.com/). Am I missing an important aspect of the geodesy.py namespace?"

    Message generation depends on geometry_msgs, thus this dependency must be
    propagated in catkin_package().

  body: >
    The metapackage `<description>` says:


    > Geographic information metapackage. DEPRECATED for wet packages, use only
    to resolve dry stack dependencies.


    Although intended only to describe the metapackage itself, this appears to
    deprecate the entire repository, which is confusing.

  title: ROS Hydro header file installation bug
  body: >
    The geodesy headers are installed to
    `/opt/ros/hydro/include/geodesy/include/geodesy/*.h` instead of
    `/opt/ros/hydro/include/geodesy/*.h`.


    Thus the headers are not found if you try to build a dependent package.
