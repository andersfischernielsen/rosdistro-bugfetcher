  title: Export architecture_independent flag in package.xml
  body: >
    This package doesn't have any binaries in it, so it can be marked as
    architecture independent.


    Tested on the RPM buildfarm (http://csc.mcs.sdsmt.edu/jenkins/):

    - [x] No regressions

    - [x] No binaries installed


    See:

    - https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/issues/4037

    - https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/bloom/pull/270

    Thanks!

  title: rocon_device_msgs erroneous in metapackage
  body: >
    References exist to both `rocon_device_msgs` (metapackage) and
    `rocon_devices_msgs`. In english it should be `rocon_device_msgs` - only one
    sssssss!


    Also don't need to refer to the package inside the package when creating
    dependant msg variables.

    Several times lately, when updating my hydro-devel workspace and then

    Fix minor problems discovered while back-porting to hydro branch, see: #57.
    - remove unneeded dependency on concert_msgs
    - make package version agree with rest of hydro_devel rocon_msgs

  title: 'scheduler_msgs and rocon_std_msgs: please release to Hydro'
  body: >
    It would be more convenient to me if reasonable versions of
    **scheduler_msgs** and **rocon_std_msgs** could be added to the current
    Hydro release of **rocon_msgs**. Otherwise **rocon_scheduler_requests**
    fails its devel tests and cannot generate API documentation in the wiki
    because those packages are missing.


    I don't believe it will break any old Hydro code, because they are new
    packages. The dependency on **concert_msgs** is unused and should be
    removed, anyway.

    - If this is acceptable, I will provide a pull request to update the hydro
    branch.

    - If it's not worth the hassle, please just close this issue.

  title: rocon_msgs depend on missing rocon-demo-msgs in Groovy
  body: >
    Looks like someone deleted those demo msgs, but forgot to remove them from
    the Groovy dependency list (they are removed in Hydro).


    We need to re-release the messages for Groovy with that change.
