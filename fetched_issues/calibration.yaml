    These packages don't have any binaries in them, so they can be marked as

    Tested on the RPM buildfarm (http://csc.mcs.sdsmt.edu/jenkins/):

    - [x] No regressions

    - [x] No binaries installed


    See:

    Already posted in #19 but probably indeed deserves own issue. Already have
    ros-hydro-urdfdom-py installed, so this apparently does not fix things.

  title: Feature/urdf parser py
  body: >
    From [this issue thread in
    robot_model_py](https://github.com/laas/robot_model_py/issues/4#issuecomment-20947614)
    - These changes incorporate urdf_parser_py, including newer features in the
    'master' branch (currently supporting groovy / hyrdo).


    I have run the unittests in calibration_estimation (the only package that
    seems to have depended on urdf_parser) and verified that there are no
    differences in running with these changes: [unittest
    comparison](https://github.com/eacousineau/calibration/blob/c619998fb3e5ae20a4c193884b949e69c4518a13/calibration_estimation/urdf_parser_py-unittests.txt)
