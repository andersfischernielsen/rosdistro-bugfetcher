  title: Two fixes for Melodic.
  body: "In p2os_driver, the p2os_msgs_gencpp doesn't exist (and, as\r\nfar as I can tell, never existed).  It worked up until recently\r\nbecause older versions of CMake would complain but not fail,\r\nwhile more recent cmake versions actually fail.  Just remove\r\nthe dependency.\r\n\r\nThe second fix is a cosmetic issue, where CMake would spew a\r\nbunch of warnings on the command line.  Increase the version\r\nto 3.9.5 to match other CMakeLists.txt and to get rid of the\r\nwarnings.\r\n\r\n@allenh1 This should fix the current problems on the ROS buildfarm [here](http://build.ros.org/view/Mbin_uB64/job/Mbin_uB64__p2os_driver__ubuntu_bionic_amd64__binary/6/consoleFull)."

  body: >
    Currently, this just prints the sonar array and converts them to doubles. It
    also converted the sonars to be stored as a `std::unique_ptr<double[]>`
    internally.

  title: '[question] use of collada_urdf.cpp and dependency on tinyxml'
  body: >-
    I was just wondering what is the use of
    [collada_urdf.cpp](https://github.com/allenh1/p2os/blob/master/p2os_urdf/models/collada_urdf.cpp)
    in this repository. I came across this by tracking down packages downstream
    of pluginlib that use tinyxml symbols without depending on it.

  title: p2os_urdf  build failure due to undeclared linking dependency
  body: >
    p2os_urdf is failing to build now due to missing symbols at link time. It
    appears to have become a problem due to robot_state_publisher switching to
    use tf2 from tf and not longer exporting link flags needed for this package.

    I think it just takes adding `tf` to as a `CATKIN_DEPENDS`

  title: message_runtime and message_generation dependency only on msg package.
  body: >
    I have noticed that all p2os packages are depending on message_generation
    and message_runtime package. These two packages would only need on
    `p2os_msgs` packakge.

  title: p2os_launch cleanup
  body: >
    The p2os_launch package contains many launchfiles with huge dependencies
    that are not mentioned in the package.xml file as run_depends.


    The purpose of this package must be clarified. It should contain only p2os
    specific functionality, clearly stated and well documented.


    The diagnostic analysers should be restructured, now all diagnostic messages
    are sent to sensors \ sensors \ p2os (which is redundant and not useful).

  title: p2os_driver p2os-joystick-teleop.xml
  body: >
    There is a launch file in p2os_driver that has nothing to do with the
    package or its' dependencies.

    It should be removed from p2os_driver and if launch files are to be
    provided, they should contain code that is relevant to p2os_driver
    functionality and configuration parameters.

  title: Conform to ROS CppStyleGuide
  body: >
    Currently, p2os_driver lacks in some very important aspects.

    1. Code does not conform to the coding standards as per
    http://wiki.ros.org/CppStyleGuide

    2. Uses ROS topics for functionality that should be provided with ROS
    services (enable/disable motors etc)

    3. Uses very few diagnostic messages / publishes battery stats twice (in
    diagnostic AND in a separate topic)

    4. Has no documentation (e.g. doxygen)

    5. Has minor memory leaks (in p2osnode line 38 p is never deleted)


    We should really focus on making the code more maintainable by conforming to
    ROS standards and using the correct message types where necessary (sonar
    data should be published using a sensor_msgs/PointCloud message).

  title: Separate p2os_driver and p2os_msgs
  body: >
    It is common to separate the messages in a separate package to avoid
    unnecessary dependencies.


    For example, the dashboard (which runs on a separate PC) needs the messages
    to communicate with the robot, however it does not need the driver.


    I think that we should also separate the messages in a package named
    p2os_msgs that p2os_driver should build_depend upon.
