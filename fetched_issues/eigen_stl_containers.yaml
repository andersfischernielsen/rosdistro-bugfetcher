  title: Switch over to package XML format version 2
  body: >-
    This makes it more compatible with ROS2.  Also minor fixups while we are in
    here, to cleanup trailing whitespace, include headers where necessary, and
    remove an unnecessary run/exec dependency on eigen (eigen is a header-only
    library, so by definition it is only needed at build time).

  body: >
    In addition to  #5, fixed EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIRS problem, reported at
    https://github.com/ros/robot_model/issues/149


    Xenial uses eigen 3.5, where as Willy uses 3.2 and 3.2 only provides
    EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR where eigen 3.5 provides EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIRS

    otherwise will have following warning and could not build as reporeted at
    https://github.com/ros/robot_model/issues/149
