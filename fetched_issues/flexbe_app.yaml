  title: Explicit state package feature bug
  body: "I am encountering an issue when i save my Flexbe behaviors with the latest release. I believe it has stemmed from the changes made in this commit, https://github.com/FlexBE/flexbe_app/commit/e4b90f3a71d03e26bf5b72cdd93f6ff1e22b2013 . When behaviors are saved in the app it gives imported behaviors aliases which are not handled  (i.e renamed) in the the rest of that behaviors file.\r\n![screenshot from 2019-01-17 15-17-22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15118900/51297185-05a47e80-1a6b-11e9-889a-e44ef697fc59.png)\r\n\r\nWas the idea to just give aliases to the imported **states** only? I notice when you turn off the explicit state package feature in the settings it has no effect on the behavior imports, they are still given an alias. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n"

  title: 'feat: Save new/changed behavior on the robot through SSH'
  body: "## What I did:\r\n- Used [scp2](https://github.com/spmjs/node-scp2) and [ssh2](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2) node modules to update the behavior package on the robot according to new changes made on this package (adding new behavior, modifying an existing one) through SSH.\r\n- The SSH configurations (hostname and username) shall be set in new input boxes provided in **Code Generation** section of **Configuration** tab. This feature is **disabled** by default and it can be set to enabled from the same section.\r\n![screenshot from 2018-06-03 13-27-16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2716644/40886076-ecb27536-6731-11e8-8ae2-94976c60e8d2.png)\r\n\r\n- For security reasons (to don't store it as a cookie) password will be prompted on clicking the **save behavior** button.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2716644/40886078-ff2a760a-6731-11e8-9cb8-3c379a64910b.png)\r\n- Refactored the **package.json** and added dependency to **scp2** module.\r\n\r\n## Important notes:\r\n- The behavior package **shall** be already available on the robot.\r\n- In order to be able to find package the path, the ROS environment variables shall be set properly on **.profile** script. \r\n- In order to use this new feature its dependencies needs to be installed. To do so, the `npm install` command will be automatically executed during `cmake`.\r\n- If you saw any indentation incossitency, its because of using tabs instead of spaces in the whole original source code, while I used 4-spaces. This shall be fixed in a separate PR.\r\n## Feature works:\r\n- Unfortunately, javascript doesn't provide a prompt box with password masking feature, as a matter of the fact, the current password prompt is unmasked. A proper solution is to replace the usage of the password with SSH keys.\r\n- Currently, the whole package will be overwritten by clicking on save behavior. This can be improved by just updating the modified files. "

  title: Add cmake install rules and use rospack to find nw executable
  body: "This PR adds install rules to `CMakeLists.txt` that allow to run the FlexBE App from an install-space.\r\n\r\nTo make it work I had to replace the search paths relative to the location of the `run_app` and `shortcut` scripts by calls to `rospack find`. `rospack` is a dependency anyway because it's called from [src/ros/ros.js:53](https://github.com/meyerj/flexbe_app/blob/16d0cd474ca969ec10598d1e2bdacd5fef66181d/src/ros/ros.js#L53)."

  title: State file name overwritten in Behavior source code when saving
  body: "I have pulled the latest development repo in order to utilise the new 'update state when source code changes' feature. However I seem to have come across a bug which prevents me from running the behavior. Every time I save the behavior the file name of the State ( in this case- jp_picking_main.py)  changes in the behavior source code. As seen below on 2nd last line.\r\n## Expected Behavior Source Code:\r\n```python\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python\r\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\r\n###########################################################\r\n#               WARNING: Generated code!                  #\r\n#              **************************                 #\r\n# Manual changes may get lost if file is generated again. #\r\n# Only code inside the [MANUAL] tags will be kept.        #\r\n###########################################################\r\n\r\nfrom flexbe_core import Behavior, Autonomy, OperatableStateMachine, ConcurrencyContainer, PriorityContainer, Logger\r\nfrom kr3_flexbe_states.jp_picking_main import JP_FindAndPick\r\nfrom flexbe_states.log_state import LogState\r\n```\r\n## Actual Behavior Source Code:\r\n```python\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python\r\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\r\n###########################################################\r\n#               WARNING: Generated code!                  #\r\n#              **************************                 #\r\n# Manual changes may get lost if file is generated again. #\r\n# Only code inside the [MANUAL] tags will be kept.        #\r\n###########################################################\r\n\r\nfrom flexbe_core import Behavior, Autonomy, OperatableStateMachine, ConcurrencyContainer, PriorityContainer, Logger\r\nfrom kr3_flexbe_states..goutputstream-C9ESGZ import JP_FindAndPick\r\nfrom flexbe_states.log_state import LogState\r\n```\r\nI then proceed to get the following output when running the behavior :\r\n```javascript\r\n[07:55:57] --> Starting new behavior...\r\n[07:55:57] Exception caught in behavior definition: [-]\r\n    invalid syntax (tmp_-826516856.py, line 12)\r\n[07:55:57] No behavior active.\r\n[07:55:57] Dropped behavior start request because preparation failed.\r\n```\r\nAny thoughts? cheers!"
