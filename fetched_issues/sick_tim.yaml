  title: sick mrs1000 driver
  body: "  The pull request concerns the sick mrs 1000 support. The initialization of the device has to be different, due to that I have made the methods for initialization virtual and now the mrs1000 driver runs different init code. Also the support for PointCloud2 is new. \r\nSry for not having enough separate commits for the different stages of the code, I could not really test these interdependent code fragments, also I saw a limit in spending my time in a driver which needs – in a long term perspective – a rewrite. Probably I will have time for that in 2018, sometime.\r\ncheers "

  title: sick_tim310s01 does not work on Ubuntu Mate 16.04/Raspberry Pi 3
  body: >
    In a classroom setup we have tried to get the sick_tim310s01 node up an
    running on a Raspberry Pi 3 running Ubuntu Mate 16.04. The setup works well
    on a laptop running Ubuntu 16.04 but on the raspi it is apparently unable to
    communicate with the TIM310 and causes a stack smashing error. (identical
    files under ros workspace, just moving the usb cable) 


    The sick_tim551_2050001 node works well under both configurations, so the
    detected problem seems to be isolated to the sick_tim310s01 node.


    The problem was reproduced independently by two student teams and the
    lecturer.


    Below is the rosout error when running on the raspi 3:

    It was actually broken (detected on other machine) because the library
    didn't have the _gencfg dependency.

    Now works and the dependencies are factorized.


    Sorry for the "noise".
