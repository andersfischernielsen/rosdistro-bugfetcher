  title: Show non ROS package
  body: "AFAIUC currently `rqt_dep` only shows ROS package (or `catkin` package to be more precise?). It'd be nice if it shows non ROS packages in addition.\r\n\r\nI assume traversing packages is done by `rospkg` functionality, which uses information in package.xml where non-catkin package dependencies can be listed up. Since rospkg can return non-catkin? package names by e.g. `RosPack.get_rosdeps`, we should be able to add this functionality.\r\n\r\nNote I don't think rospkg can find the dependency of non-catkin packages.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't have to be done in ROS ecosystem (although so far I haven't found other tools that visualize dependency tree well), but because implementation might not be that hard, I think it's worthwhile feature.\r\n"

  title: display package info from different distro?
  body: >-
    _From @scpeters on March 8, 2016 0:46_


    We are approaching releasing season for ROS K, and a common question is
    which packages are blocking the release of other packages. The `rqt_dep`
    tool is great for visualizing package dependencies. It would be great if we
    could use this tool to visualize which packages have been released into a
    new ROS distro, to identify the blockages.


    In discussing this in the past, a known complicating factor is that
    dependencies may change from one ROS distro to the next, so this can be an
    ill-posed problem in some cases.


    Most of the time, though, the dependencies don't change from one distro to
    the next. As a first step, I would load `rqt_dep` with the most recently
    released ROS distro (jade at the moment) and would like to select another
    distro from a drop-down combo-box and then colorize the graph.


    Any hints are welcome.

    Probably 3 tick boxes around. Any better design ? I could have a look at it,
    I am sure it is trivial to add.
