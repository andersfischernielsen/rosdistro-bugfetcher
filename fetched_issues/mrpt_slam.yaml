  title: Missing csl_common dependency found in .launch
  body: "I'm currently doing some research on static analysis of ROS packages at the IT University of Copenhagen, more specifically dependency checking of `.launch` files in ROS packages.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a `$(find csl_common)` in\r\n\r\n- `mrpt_slam/mrpt_graphslam_2d/launch/setup_robot_for_mr_demo.launch`\r\nthat's not declared in `mrpt_slam/mrpt_graphslam_2d`\r\n\r\nInstalling `mrpt_slam` without having `csl_common` installed would make `roslaunch` fail on this `.launch` file, right?\r\n\r\nI'm unsure whether this is a dependency bug, since it is only in one specific demo configuration. Nonetheless, `roslaunch` would fail, right?"

    Now this repo should have a clean build.


    I removed dependency from `mrpt_libs`, because I couldn't find anything like
    it. I am not sure about this change.
