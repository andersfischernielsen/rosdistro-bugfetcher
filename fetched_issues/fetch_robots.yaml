  title: 'TODO: switch to official SICK drivers'
  body: "We depend on `ros-melodic-sick-tim` package from https://github.com/uos/sick_tim/ which for the purpose of the upcoming release to melodic fetchrobotics/fetch_ros#63 is fine.\r\n\r\nBut we should switch over to the official drivers: https://github.com/SICKAG/sick_scan which is `ros-melodic-sick-scan` at some point in the future.\r\n\r\nThis won't be for the initial ros-melodic release, because we want that to get out with the next melodic sync and won't have time for the additional tests.\r\n\r\n@chadrockey are you aware of any major differences?"
