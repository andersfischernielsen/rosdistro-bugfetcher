  title: Qt to Dot Package
  body: >
    See #2 for some rants about this package. It's buggy, poorly does the
    multi-package abstraction and incomplete with respect to dot functionality.


    I've imported this internally for the moment, but I'd like this to go back
    upstream eventually. Just the amount of work we have to do on it would take
    forever to push upstream and probably require quite some ping pong. Need to
    consider how to do this cleanly.
