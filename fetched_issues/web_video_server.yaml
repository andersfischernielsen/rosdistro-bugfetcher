  title: Conflicting Versions of OpenCV
  body: >-
    There seems to be issues with other ROS packages that use OpenCV 3.2. I have
    many ros packages dependent on 3.2, but when running `rosrun
    web_video_server web_video_server `, the following error occurred:
    `/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/web_video_server/web_video_server: error while loading
    shared libraries: libopencv_core3.so.3.3: cannot open shared object file: No
    such file or directory`, thus trying to link against the version other ros
    packages are dependent upon. I fixed this issue via source install, cloning
    the respiratory and running catkin_make.

  title: vp8 encoding is flakey in browsers and in vlc
  body: >
    Using the develop branch: We saw that after a time, the vp8 streams in a
    browser slowed down after 5-10 seconds to about 1 frame every few seconds.
    Playing the same stream with vlc version 2.1.4 gives these outputs during
    such slowdown:


    [0x7f9ce80009b8] main input error: ES_OUT_SET_(GROUP_)PCR  is called too
    late (pts_delay increased to 1000 ms)

    [0x7f9ce80009b8] main input error: ES_OUT_RESET_PCR called

    vlc eventually recovers and the stream becomes fluent again, but our Chrome
    browser does not.

    This issue doesn't crop up when streaming as an mjpeg, although vlc gives in
    that case:

    "[mjpeg @ 0x7f0168c277e0] No JPEG data found in image" a zillion times...
