  body: >-
    On most places it should be sufficient to just include `Eigen/Core` instead
    of the entire Eigen project. This could improve compile times (also for
    depending projects).

  title: Missing message in CMakeLists.txt (in tag 3.0.0)
  body: >
    I don't know if i should create an issue for this but i was having problems
    compiling PX4 firmware (https://github.com/PX4/Firmware) using ROS command
    "catkin_make". One of the dependencies was mav_comm/mav_msgs. Using
    rosinstall_generator, i downloaded mav_comm 3.0.0 version. When i was
    compiling it, i got an error saying "CommandMotorSpeed.h" was not found.


    After checking CMakeLists.txt from mav_msgs i found that
    CommandMotorSpeed.msg was missing from add_message_files. So, when running
    catkin_make the files needed to use CommandMotorSpeed message wasn't created
    and PX4 build fail with the error above.


    I added CommandMotorSpeed.msg to CMakeLists.txt and everything worked fine.
