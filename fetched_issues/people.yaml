  title: Namspace issue with nh_.resolveName
  body: >
    I think I'm having an issue with the use of `nh_.resolveName` messing up the
    `face_detector`'s ability to subscribe to specified topics while within a
    namespace. See the info below:

    ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2293573/13024364/74c918e8-d1c1-11e5-9f83-36e87a00dbef.png)


    Notice that `camera_info` is the only properly connected topic in the
    mismatched bunch. I believe this is due to the fact that it's one of the few
    topics not filtered by `nh_.resolveName`:
    [face_detection.cpp#L249](https://github.com/wg-perception/people/blob/8dc5a7e2965fdee76b4b7d2621224f7afe9e1dc3/face_detector/src/face_detection.cpp#L249)


    Here is the launch file that works for the simple simulated turtlebot in
    gazebo, yet not in the `robot_0` namespace I'm importing it into without
    overriding default any args:


    ``` xml

    <launch>

      <arg name="fixed_frame" default="camera_rgb_frame" />

      <!--include file="$(find openni_launch)/launch/openni.launch"/-->
      <node name="$(anon dynparam)" pkg="dynamic_reconfigure" type="dynparam" args="set_from_parameters $(arg camera)/driver">
        <param name="depth_registration" type="bool" value="true" />
      </node>

     <node pkg="face_detector" type="face_detector" name="face_detector" output="screen">
        <param name="fixed_frame" type="string" value="$(arg fixed_frame)" />
        <param name="classifier_name" type="string" value="frontalface" />
        <rosparam command="load" file="$(find face_detector)/param/classifier.yaml"/>
        <param name="classifier_reliability" type="double" value="0.9"/>
        <param name="do_continuous" type="bool" value="true" />
        <param name="do_publish_faces_of_unknown_size" type="bool" value="false" />
        <param name="do_display" type="bool" value="false" />
        <param name="use_rgbd" type="bool" value="true" />
        <param name="approximate_sync" type="bool" value="true" />
      </node>

    </launch>

    ```

  title: Connection between face_detector and leg_detector
  body: >
    It is hinted in the [leg_detector wiki
    page](http://wiki.ros.org/leg_detector?distro=hydro#Possible_Usages) that
    the leg_detector can be seeded with input from the face_detector. However,
    the output from the face_detector on `/people_tracker_measurements_array` is
    `people_msgs/PositionMeasurementArray` even though the [wiki page for
    face_detector](http://wiki.ros.org/face_detector#Published_Topics) syas that
    it should output `people_msgs/PositionMeasurement`s on
    `/people_tracker_measurements`.


    I guess the leg_detector could easily handle an array in a for loop in the
    [peopleCalback](http://docs.ros.org/hydro/api/leg_detector/html/leg__detector_8cpp_source.html#l00352).

  title: leg_detector launch files point to wrong map_laser files
  body: >
    The file `filtered_leg_detector.launch` tries to include:


    ```

    <include file="$(find map_laser)/lfilter.launch"/>

    ```


    Which does not exist in the current version of the map_laser package from
    the hydro repositories. The correct include would be:


    ```

    <include file="$(find map_laser)/config/lfilter.launch"/>

    ```


    The `shadows.launch` has a similar problem:


    ```

    <rosparam command="load" file="$(find map_laser)/filters.yaml" />

    ```


    Should be 


    ```

    <rosparam command="load" file="$(find map_laser)/config/filters.yaml" />

    ```


    to make it work with the current version of map_laser.
