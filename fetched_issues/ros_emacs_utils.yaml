  title: Yasnippets from Debian packages under Ubuntu 12.04
  body: |
    I tried:
    1. yasnippet from debian package
    2. rosrun roslisp_repl roslisp_repl

    I got:

    Symbol's function definition is void: yas-global-mode

  title: Default output not redirected to `*slime-repl sbcl*`
  body: >
    When during SBCL startup in the repl, `swank:*globally-redirect-io*` is set
    to `nil` (which it is by default right now), all (or most?) output from
    `(format ...)` and `(ros-info ...)` and alike goes to `*inferior-lisp*`
    instead of `*slime-repl sbcl*`. I found this out totally by chance, when I
    realized that most of my usual output disappears into nirvana.


    Setting the flag in
    `~/catkin_ws/install/share/common-lisp/source/slime/contrib/swank-repl.lisp`
    to `t` and restarting the inferior lisp brings it back to normal.


    This wasn't like that before, so I assume this is a bug. Or is this an
    intended change?


    @gheorghelisca and me ran into this problem. @airballking, does this concern
    you as well?

  title: ASDF priority loading
  body: >
    The original debian package for slime has a priority over our slime_wrapper
    in some cases. It's not ensured with the current setup (.sbclrc) that ASDF
    always finds the slime_wrapper systems before the original ones.
