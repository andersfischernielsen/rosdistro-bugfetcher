    It looks like all of the dependencies for this package are available in
    Melodic, so it would be great to get it released there.  Thanks in advance.

    While running rqt_robot_monitor I get a continuous stream of the following
    in the parent terminal:


    ```

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/alex/ros_rocksteady_gui/src/rqt_robot_plugins/rqt_robot_monitor/src/rqt_robot_monitor/timeline_view.py", line 194, in _slot_redraw
        for i, m in enumerate(self._timeline):
      File "/home/alex/ros_rocksteady_gui/src/rqt_robot_plugins/rqt_robot_monitor/src/rqt_robot_monitor/timeline.p  y", line 158, in __iter__
        for msg in self._queue:
    RuntimeError: deque mutated during iteration

    ```


    Looks like the timeline queue is being modified by the ROS message callback
    in the `Timeline` class while at the same time being iterated over by
    `TimelineView`. I'm not what a good fix is, but I'm guessing this is causing
    more than just annoying error messages because I also see frequent
    rqt_robot_monitor freezes and crashes - most often when using the inspector
    window.
