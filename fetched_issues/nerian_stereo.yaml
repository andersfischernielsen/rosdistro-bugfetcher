  title: 'NameError: global name ''StereoCameraInfo'' is not defined'
  body: "I can't get the camera info through a ROS node since the message seems to be not defined. Do we need to include `nerian_stereo` as a dependency into our ROS packages? If yes, does adding these lines  to any `package.xml` suffice? Or do we need to do  more?\r\n\r\n```\r\n<build_depend>nerian_stereo</build_depend>\r\n<exec_depend>nerian_stereo</exec_depend>\r\n<build_export_depend>nerian_stereo</build_export_depend>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause right now, `from nerian_stereo import *` is not recognized, and hence `NameError: global name 'StereoCameraInfo' is not defined` is thrown."
