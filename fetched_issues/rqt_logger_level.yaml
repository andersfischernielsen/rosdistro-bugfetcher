    On my machine, with a reasonable number of nodes running on a remote PR2,
    rxloggerlevel takes about 6 seconds too start, rqt_logger_level about 12.
    Similarly a refresh in rxloggerlevel takes 3 secs, rqt_loggerlevel 12 again.


    Since they do roughly the same, I assume that is a bug in rqt_loggerlevel.
    Probably you won't notice if the nodes are running locally or just a few
    nodes.
