    [FetchIt!] [BUG] RobotStatePublisher for Schunk machine breaks robot's /odom
    transform
  body: "**Description:**\r\nYou have defined the Schunk machine as a second robot with its own `robot_state_publisher`.  However, this is not configured correctly and it breaks the TF tree for the Fetch robot's `/base_link` to `/odom` transform.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why this was working previously, but it should not have been.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nLaunch the simulation environment:  \r\n```\r\n$ roslaunch fetchit_challenge main_arena_montreal2019_highlights.launch\r\n```\r\nCheck this TF transform:\r\n```\r\n$ rosrun tf tf_echo /base_link /odom\r\n```\r\nYou should see:  \r\n```\r\nAt time 0.0\r\n- Translation: [0.000, 0.000, 0.000]\r\n- Rotation: in Quaternion [0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 1.000]\r\n            in RPY (radian) [0.000, -0.000, 0.000]\r\n            in RPY (degree) [0.000, -0.000, 0.000]\r\n```\r\nwhere the timestamp is stuck at zero.  \r\nAlso, if you generate the diagram of TF frames, you can see that the Schunk machine is connected directly to the robot's `/base_link`, which is incorrect.\r\n\r\nThen, remove the `robot_state_publisher` in `shunk_machine_control.launch` and repeat.  \r\nYou should see the correct output:  \r\n```\r\nAt time 9.537\r\n- Translation: [0.000, 0.000, 0.000]\r\n- Rotation: in Quaternion [0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 1.000]\r\n            in RPY (radian) [0.000, -0.000, 0.000]\r\n            in RPY (degree) [0.000, -0.000, 0.000]\r\n```\r\nwhere the timestamp is changing.\r\n\r\n**Screenshot:**\r\nThis shows the TF tree with bad connection:  \r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2sipH2v.png)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nEach robot can have a `/base_link` but the TF frames need to be namespaced, like:  \r\n```\r\n/fetch_robot1/base_link/\r\n/schunk_machine/base_link/\r\n```\r\nand then the two robots are connected in the TF tree via the `/map` frame.\r\n\r\nSee the example in the first image on this page:  \r\nhttps://answers.ros.org/question/258948/why-tf-trees-for-multi-robot-system-not-showing/\r\n\r\nOr you could try a hard-coded approach and write a simple node that publishes a static TF with the Schunk's location.\r\n\r\n**System configuration:**\r\n - fetch_gazebo version: Latest master branch\r\n - Ubuntu version: 18.04\r\n - ROS version: Melodic\r\n\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n"

  title: How to get Fetch and Gazebo9 installed and tested?
  body: "Hi Fetch Support,\r\n\r\nWe have an Ubuntu 18.04 machine with Ros Melodic and Gazebo9 installed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nadiganapathi@hermes1-ubuntu18:~/catkin_ws$ gazebo --version\r\nGazebo multi-robot simulator, version 9.0.0\r\nCopyright (C) 2012 Open Source Robotics Foundation.\r\nReleased under the Apache 2 License.\r\nhttp://gazebosim.org\r\n\r\n\r\nGazebo multi-robot simulator, version 9.0.0\r\nCopyright (C) 2012 Open Source Robotics Foundation.\r\nReleased under the Apache 2 License.\r\nhttp://gazebosim.org\r\n\r\n\r\nadiganapathi@hermes1-ubuntu18:~/catkin_ws$ \r\n```\r\n\r\nWe are trying to get the Fetch robot started in the Gazebo simulator. We have read the other issues here and are aware that there are several problems with the simulator, but we would like to even get the simulator *started* so that we can observe these problems. The question is, how to install?\r\n\r\nIn our Ubuntu 14.04 machines with Fetch installed, running the Fetch on the Gazebo is easy because it just involves installing a package [as shown in your README](http://docs.fetchrobotics.com/gazebo.html).\r\n\r\nHowever, such a package does not appear to be available for Ubuntu 18.04,[ as suggested by this question on Ros Answers](https://answers.ros.org/question/305685/can-robot-models-for-simulations-be-used-in-all-ros-versions/). That question was answered on October 2018, so perhaps there has been an update since then? But we cannot do a sudo apt-get installed. This is what we see after doing a `sudo apt-get update` beforehand:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-fetch-gazebo-demo\r\nReading package lists... Done\r\nBuilding dependency tree       \r\nReading state information... Done\r\nE: Unable to locate package ros-melodic-fetch-gazebo-demo\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, we figured we would try a \"manual\" installation. To our knowledge, this is done by cloning this repository into `catkin_ws/src` and then doing `catkin_make` to build. Here is our output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nadiganapathi@hermes1-ubuntu18:~$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src\r\nadiganapathi@hermes1-ubuntu18:~$ cd catkin_ws/src/\r\nadiganapathi@hermes1-ubuntu18:~/catkin_ws/src$ git clone https://github.com/fetchrobotics/fetch_gazebo.git\r\nCloning into 'fetch_gazebo'...\r\nremote: Enumerating objects: 34, done.\r\nremote: Counting objects: 100% (34/34), done.\r\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (19/19), done.\r\nremote: Total 1167 (delta 14), reused 33 (delta 14), pack-reused 1133\r\nReceiving objects: 100% (1167/1167), 16.86 MiB | 31.00 MiB/s, done.\r\nResolving deltas: 100% (606/606), done.\r\nadiganapathi@hermes1-ubuntu18:~/catkin_ws/src$ cd ..\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then running `catkin_make` results in the following [output in the following pastebin](https://pastebin.com/GVv9scKT).\r\n\r\nIt suggests to install some \"robot_controllers\" package, but we are not sure what that refers to, or if installing this is on the right track towards getting the Fetch displayed in the Gazebo.\r\n\r\nHopefully this issue shows what we are trying to do --- just getting the Fetch displayed in our Gazebo. Are these the right steps to follow? If not, where may we find the steps?\r\n\r\nWe're happy to provide any more information about our setup if necessary.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time!"

    Dependent repositories still to be released into Jade:

    - [x] robot_controllers [(Pull
    Request)](https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/pull/9013)

    - [x] robot_calibration (so we can release fetch_ros repo) [(Pull
    Request)](https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/pull/9053)

    - [x] warehouse_ros (so we can release moveit_ros)

    - [x] moveit_ros (maybe other packages in moveit)

    - [x] moveit_planners (https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/pull/9073)

    - [x] fetch_ros (fetch_description, fetch_navigation, fetch_moveit_config)


    Fixes to fetch_gazebo:

    - [x] update package.xml depends for gazebo 5

    - [ ] one section of bellows and the estop are showing as white?


    Possible improvements:

    - [ ] use new friction models to improve simulation


    Currently there is a jade-devel branch, but we may want to rename that
    "gazebo5" and then rename master to "gazebo2" as the gazebo version is
    actually the driving factor rather than the ROS version (for instance, you
    can use gazebo5 with indigo if you build fetch_gazebo and gazebo_ros from
    source as well)
