  title: Wait for transform in transformPointCloud().
  body: >-
    Just wanted to add this myself, but found this fork by @shuntaraw adding a
    wait for transform in transformPointCloud(). The fact that there is no wait
    for transform so far means that it depends on sheer luck (and some factors
    like system load etc.) wether data can be transformed or not when another
    input frame is selected for the incoming cloud. It's kind of fascinating
    that no one ran into this in the last 6 years :)

  title: Qt5 dependency
  body: "@wkentaro @paulbovbel I'm opening this for visibility and share my findings when looking into the Qt dependency issue and am open to discussion to reduce the scope or close it if it's not considered of interest.\r\nThis is an alternative to https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl/pull/146\r\n\r\nI looked a bit more into this issue #139:\r\nto answer the [comment](https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl/pull/142#issuecomment-298602081):\r\n> I still don't understand why pcl_ros depends on qt..\r\n\r\nIt is because PCL depends on vtk6 rendering tools including the Qt ones. Given that `pcl_ros` finds **all** PCL_LIBRARIES, as a result, `pcl_ros` libraries link against all vtk libraries used by PCL, including the ones depending on Qt.\r\nTo avoid depending and linking against libraries you don't use, it is good practice to `find_package()` only the components that you use. See the [first commit](https://github.com/mikaelarguedas/perception_pcl/commit/f968425079a292c3fc64829150c583bea9af2411) of this PR for a suggestion.\r\n\r\nThis change would **not** allow to get rid of the Qt5Widgets dependency though because the PCL `io` module exports dependencies on Qt5::Widgets (not sure why :confused:)\r\nLooking a bit further into the libraries reported by the PCL IO module, it looks like several of them use Qt: see https://github.com/mikaelarguedas/perception_pcl/commit/54d94db9ae739f8bc8b81abde1f89b22490ad69a for a list.\r\n\r\nAs Far A I Understand, Ubuntu knows it is a problem and decided to make `libpcl-dev` [depend on](https://packages.ubuntu.com/zesty/libpcl-dev) `libvtk6-qt-dev` rather than fixing the root of the problem. That is why this problem doesn't appear on Ubuntu but only on debian Stretch ([no dependency on](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/libpcl-dev) `libvtk6-qt-dev`).\r\n\r\nPossible solutions: \r\n - keep the Qt5Widgets import workaround adding an unused dependency\r\n - merge this PR that allows to get rid of the dependency on Qt but make the CMake code a bit more complex.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I'll try to find out why even the io module depends on Qt and where to report the issue to get it fixed upstream"
