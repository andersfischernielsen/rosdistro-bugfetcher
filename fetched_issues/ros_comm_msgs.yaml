    Hydro versions
    ([ros_comm](https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/tree/hydro-devel/messages)) >
    Indigo versions ([ros_comm_msgs](https://github.com/ros/ros_comm_msgs)). 


    These are [1.10.12](http://www.ros.org/debbuild/hydro.html?q=rosgraph_msgs)
    vs [1.10.3](http://www.ros.org/debbuild/indigo.html?q=rosgraph_msgs)
    respectively.


    This is causing a problem in the java maven repositories where it's not only
    writing over older versions, but pulling in older hydro versions when given
    an open ended version dependency (e.g. [1.10, 1.11)).


    Might these indigo versions get a nudge?
