  title: DXF to Graph converter not creating a graph.launch file
  body: "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nI am quite new to ros and C++ and have no experience with CAD so sorry if this question is novice.\r\n\r\nI am attempting to create a Custom Graph by following the [documentation](https://github.com/tuw-robotics/tuw_multi_robot/blob/master/tuw_multi_robot_demo/tutorials/demo_custom_graph.md) but seem to be doing something incorrectly.\r\n\r\nI have downloaded LibreCAD and successfully imported a .pgm image into it. I then created a new layer and drew some simple lines around the obstacles. Like so:\r\n\r\n![LibreCAD](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37916145/57111136-9e03fd80-6d00-11e9-98db-3cbec76ea4e4.png)\r\n\r\nAfter drawing everything, I saved the file as ``` tuw_multi_robot_demo/cfg/dxf/$ROOM/$DXF_NAME.dxf ```, replacing $ROOM with 'suddath' and $DXF_NAME with 'suddath_warehouse'.\r\n\r\nI then ran the converter node, like so:\r\n\r\n```roslaunch tuw_multi_robot_demo dxf_to_graph.launch dxf_name:=suddath_warehouse.dxf room:=suddath graph_name:=suddath_graph ```\r\n\r\nHere is the output, which appears to be successful:\r\n\r\n![zzTUWError1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37916145/57111479-d48e4800-6d01-11e9-977d-c694ca0f5c3d.png)\r\n\r\nSo now, I should be ready to use the graph. I attempt to do so by running the following command:\r\n\r\n```roslaunch tuw_multi_robot_demo demo.launch room:=suddath map_name:=suddath_graph load_segments:=true```\r\n\r\nThis is where the following error occurs:\r\n\r\n![zzTUWError2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37916145/57111605-65652380-6d02-11e9-8c93-811bca13d2c0.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the error is occurring because there is no graph.launch file inside of the 'suddath' directory. Which is correct, there is indeed no graph.launch file, however the ```tuw_multi_robot_demo/cfg/graph/$ROOM/cache/$GRAPH_NAME/``` directory was created and the graph data was saved to it as per the documentation.\r\n\r\nMy question then, is what, if anything, am I doing wrong? Furthermore, what steps can I take to rectify this situation?\r\n\r\nThank You.\r\n\r\nP.S. It may be worth noting that I attempted to create my own graph.launch file utilizing the demo application's, but it simply started a blank world in rviz."
