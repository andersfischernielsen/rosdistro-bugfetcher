  title: Use separate node and stream config in example
  body: "*Issue #, if available:* #2 \r\n\r\n*Description of changes:* This changes splits the default configuration file for kinesis_video_streamer into two, so there is a node wide configuration for AWS client configuration, and another file for the single stream that is used in sample_application.launch. Without this change `roslaunch kinesis_video_streamer sample_application.launch` is not able to use the AWS client configuration defined on `kinesis_video_streamer/config/sample_configuration.yaml`, and `roslaunch kinesis_video_streamer sample_application.launch` crashes if the AWS region is not defined on `~/.aws/config` for a default profile\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n"
