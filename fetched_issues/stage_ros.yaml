  title: 'stage_ros malloc(): memory corruption'
  body: >
    Hi,


    I'm trying to run `stage_ros` with the example worlds but I'm getting
    `malloc(): memory corruption` error.

    I'm running on ubuntu 14.04 with ros indigo.


    When I do: `rosrun stage_ros stageros -g  willow-erratic.world` It works
    fine.


    But when I do: `rosrun stage_ros stageros willow-erratic.world` It gives me
    an error:


    ```

    malloc(): memory corruption

    ```


    Any ideas of the problem?


    Thank you very much

  title: Un-needed run_depend on fluid
  body: >
    I don't think stage_ros needs the run-depend on fluid.  fluid is a UI design
    package like qt designer and qt uic, and none of code in stage or stage_ros
    uses it.  It should be safe to remove.

  title: exported libary doesn't exist

    Where is the library `stage_ros` supposed to come from 
    (https://github.com/ros-simulation/stage_ros/blob/7062bd54c142de2d25219525bbdf23dd1109d730/CMakeLists.txt#L34)?


    I would guess it needs to be removed from the catkin_package() call.

  title: Remove runtime dependency on fltk
  body: |
    It's a lib and will be pulled in by dh_shlibdeps automatically.

    This solves a dependeny issue with libfltk1.1-dev/libfltk1.3-dev

  title: compiling on saucy is missing dlopen link flags
  body: >
    I'm not sure what changed, but my hydro compile on saucy required adding dl
    to the target_link_libraries list of libraries. This should be done in a
    cleaner method calling find_package for dlopen.

  title: stageros does not publish velocities in the odometry
  body: >
    When converting to Stage v4.1.1 the GetGlobalVelocity function was lost for
    "models", which prevents us from publishing velocities into ROS using the
    odometry message.
