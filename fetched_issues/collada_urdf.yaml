  title: Collada cleanup dependencies
  body: "This PR cleans up collada to setup the dependencies more properly, and do some other cleanup.  More specifically:\r\n\r\n1.  It switches both packages in the repository to package format 2.\r\n1.  It cleans out unnecessary includes from the header files.\r\n1.  It changes from including `class_loader.h` to `class_loader.hpp`, as the former is deprecated.\r\n1.  It removes all dependencies from this package to roscpp; only rosconsole is really needed.\r\n1.  It fixes up the dependencies in the package.xml and CMakeLists.txt to properly export dependencies to downstream users, and bring in the correct dependencies everywhere."

    [collada_urdf] lots of warning and errors when running tests due to missing
    pr2_description package
  body: "`pr2.urdf` reference meshes from the `pr2_description` package but doesn't depend on it causing a lot of errors and warnings when running tests (extract of the error log below).\r\n\r\nPossible approaches:\r\n- Remove the meshes from the urdf given that the tests don't check meshes and textures.\r\n- Add a test_dependency on `pr2_description`. This will bury pr2_description deeper in the dependency list and move us away from removing it from the `desktop-full` dependency list\r\n- Copy the pr2 meshes in this package: if the goal is to keep the urdf as is, this will allow to not add the dependency and allow future test to check for meshes conversion\r\n- Use a different urdf for testing purposes and not rely on the pr2 one\r\n- Do nothing because these are just warning but the test is still passing\r\n\r\nIMO: The least amount of effort would be to copy the meshes while fixing the test output. A longer term solution could be to use a different urdf self-contained in this package or one of its existing dependencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n[==========] Running 2 tests from 1 test case.\r\n[----------] Global test environment set-up.\r\n[----------] 2 tests from collada_urdf\r\n[ RUN      ] collada_urdf.collada_from_urdf_file_works\r\n[rospack] Error: package 'pr2_description' not found\r\n[librospack]: error while executing command\r\n[rospack] Error: package 'pr2_description' not found\r\n[librospack]: error while executing command\r\n[rospack] Error: package 'pr2_description' not found\r\n[librospack]: error while executing command\r\n[...]\r\n[rospack] Error: package 'pr2_description' not found\r\n[librospack]: error while executing command\r\n[rospack] Error: package 'pr2_description' not found\r\n[librospack]: error while executing command\r\n[rospack] Error: package 'pr2_description' not found\r\n[librospack]: error while executing command\r\n[ WARN] [1501709311.815362685]: failed to load resource package://pr2_description/meshes/base_v0/base.stl\r\n[ WARN] [1501709311.820997178]: failed to load resource package://pr2_description/meshes/base_v0/caster.stl\r\n[ WARN] [1501709311.825968026]: failed to load resource package://pr2_description/meshes/base_v0/pr2_wheel.stl\r\n[...]\r\n[ WARN] [1501709311.975670192]: failed to load resource package://pr2_description/meshes/tilting_laser_v0/hok_tilt.stl\r\n[ WARN] [1501709311.981071835]: failed to load resource package://pr2_description/meshes/shoulder_v0/shoulder_yaw.stl\r\n[ WARN] [1501709311.986110814]: failed to load resource package://pr2_description/meshes/shoulder_v0/shoulder_lift.stl\r\n\r\n```"
