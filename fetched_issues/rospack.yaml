    And I can't actually find any instances of rosdep being needed by this code:
    https://github.com/ros/rospack/search?q=rosdep&type=Code


    Is the dependency completely vestigial at this point? If so, can it be
    removed?


    Our deployed robots are not development platforms; rosdep should not be
    necessary as a runtime dependency of ROS; we'd like to eliminate having to
    install and initialize it.

    I open a PR to ask for comments although work is in progress.

    I'm adding a command that returns the license of the dependency of a
    package.


    The example looks as the following (I know this needs lots of polish):


    ```

    $ rospack depends1 navfn

    costmap_2d

    geometry_msgs

    nav_core

    nav_msgs

    pcl_conversions

    pcl_ros

    pluginlib

    rosconsole

    roscpp

    tf

    visualization_msgs


    $ rospack license navfn

    costmap_2d  BSD 

    geometry_msgs   BSD 

    nav_core    BSD 

    nav_msgs    BSD 

    pcl_conversions BSD 

    pcl_ros BSD 

    pluginlib   BSD Boost Software License 

    rosconsole  BSD 

    roscpp  BSD 

    tf  BSD 

    visualization_msgs  BSD 

    ```


    Below is just my note.


    Requirement

    - Implemented as upstream as possible --> so `rospack` should be a good
    place?

    - Multi-platform, not just on Ubuntu  --> Need ROS/Catkin specific tool that
    can handle `package.xml` where the license is declared?

    - Must work with all ROS packages whether it's deb or source.

    - Make it as both 1) public API and 2) commandline option.

    - No breakage for existing api.


    Research for existing tools

    - `debtree`: Great tool for speculating pkg dependency, with commanline
    output and even GUi output. We can aim its output.

    - `ldd`: Only works with libs.

    - `Dependency Walker`: Only works on MS Windows.

    - `binscan`: only works for binaries.

    - `ELF Library Viewer`: only works for ELF executables.

    Problem is the when I open python I can access pydebug from sys module.

    I changed this file /usr/lib/python2.7/sysconfig.py to print sys.executable
    and it's running correct python from /usr/bin/python, from which I can
    access pydebug.


    I did a small work around and hardcoded 'False' instead of sys.pydebug, but
    after I receive other error

  title: rospack depends geometry_msgs vs rosmsg packages Header
  body: >
    Hi,


    I am using ROS Fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04 and I have some problem in
    understanding the consistency of the output of the following two commands:


    $rospack depends geometry_msgs:

    <nothing>


    $rosmsg packages Header

    ...

    gazebo_msgs

    gazebo_plugins

    geometry_msgs <--

    hpPackage

    ...


    So geometry_msgs is using the Header message from std_msgs, but
    geometry_msgs does not depend on std_msgs. One example of using the Header
    message is geometry_msgs/TwistStamped:


    $rosmsg show geometry_msgs/TwistStamped

    std_msgs/Header header <--
      uint32 seq
      time stamp
      string frame_id
    geometry_msgs/Twist twist
      geometry_msgs/Vector3 linear
        float64 x
        float64 y
        float64 z
      geometry_msgs/Vector3 angular
        float64 x
        float64 y
        float64 z

    Isn't it a bug?

  title: add circular dependency detection/help (04/08/12)
  body: >
    Migrated from code.ros.org, issue #3919 

    Reported by:    tfoote

    https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/3919


    Description 


    Right now rospack just errors when the recursion depth is too deep. This
    error could easily be extended to detect and print the full cycle of the
    self recursion.


    It would help people in this situation:

    priority changed from major to minor

    status changed from new to assigned

    type changed from defect to enhancement

    Indeed, that would be useful. In the meantime, you can do something like


    rospack deps-indent > foo

    Ctrl-C it after a bit, then look at the file to try to figure out where
    things go off the rails.

    in reply to: ↑ 1   Changed 9 months ago by gerkey 


    Replying to gerkey:


    {{{ rospack deps-indent > foo }}}


    That should have a package name in it, e.g.:


    rospack deps-indent my_package > foo
