  title: CloudWatch Logger node generating a lot of logging info
  body: "Reviewing logs that are coming in and finding the cloudwatch_logger node itself generating a ton of INFO messages that seems to be consistent with the `publish_frequency`. The original 5s interval hit a API limit compared to the little logs our application sends.\r\n\r\nHere is a logs with a 60s frequency with `min_log_verbosity` set to `INFO`. We are concious about uncessary logs since these are shipped over cellular.\r\n\r\n![logs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/413937/55451189-7f8ed300-5597-11e9-98ef-8c080ae566b8.png)\r\n\r\nIs it possible to suppress this logging from the node vs bumping our logging levels within our entire application? Or would it be better to set `sub_to_rosout` to `False` and start pushing logs to a dedicated topic?\r\n\r\nAny guidance appreciated!"

  title: CloudWatcher Failing To Start
  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've been testing cloudwatcher. I updated the sample_configuration.yaml to a custom log_stream_name\r\n\r\nHowever I get the error messages below:\r\n\r\n> [ERROR] [1543682968.675952432]: [AWSClient] HTTP response code: 400\r\n> Exception name: ResourceAlreadyExistsException\r\n> Error message: The specified log group already exists\r\n> 5 response headers:\r\n> connection : close\r\n> content-length : 94\r\n> content-type : application/x-amz-json-1.1\r\n> date : Sat, 01 Dec 2018 16:49:28 GMT\r\n> x-amzn-requestid : 116c39c3-f589-11e8-be76-d3e7ff879f8f\r\n> [ERROR] [1543682968.676457696]: [CreateLogGroup] Failed to create Log Group :robot_application_name due to: The specified log group already exists, with error code: 135\r\n> [ERROR] [1543682968.790863450]: [AWSClient] HTTP response code: 400\r\n> Exception name: ResourceAlreadyExistsException\r\n> Error message: The specified log stream already exists\r\n> 5 response headers:\r\n> connection : close\r\n> content-length : 95\r\n> content-type : application/x-amz-json-1.1\r\n> date : Sat, 01 Dec 2018 16:49:27 GMT\r\n> x-amzn-requestid : 117c8dd5-f589-11e8-bd16-65b3e1494de1\r\n> [ERROR] [1543682968.791192148]: [CreateLogStream] Failed to create Log Stream :mxnet_kobuki_robot_log_stream in Log Group :robot_application_name due to: The specified log stream already exists, with error code: 135\r\n> \r\n\r\nAccording to the config file - it will try to create the log stream if it doesn't exist. Although the error messages seem to indicate otherwise.\r\n\r\nHow can I resolve this? And where should I expect the log stream to appear - I'm assuming eu-west-2 (I updated this config to reflect this.\r\n\r\nThanks and Regards\r\n\r\nMark"
