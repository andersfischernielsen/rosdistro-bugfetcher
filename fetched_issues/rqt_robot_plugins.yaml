    This is the package with the cmake config files:

    I think on ubuntu targets it's getting pulled in by an indirect dependency
    but on debian jessie it's not. 

    Jessie package not installed:

    With these patches the same code base can run with:

    - ROS Kinetic (and higher) using Qt 5


    The version dependency on `python_qt_binding` ensures that the packages
    which use `QtWidgets` are getting the changes from
    ros-visualization/python_qt_binding#31.


    This is required for a release into Kinetic.

    Looks like the timeline queue is being modified by the ROS message callback
    in the `Timeline` class while at the same time being iterated over by
    `TimelineView`. I'm not what a good fix is, but I'm guessing this is causing
    more than just annoying error messages because I also see frequent
    rqt_robot_monitor freezes and crashes - most often when using the inspector

    The old RX dashboard did this by graying out the dashboard panes if no

    You can reproduce this behavior by playing back any bag file with
    diagnostics data, and observing the dashboard behavior for 10-15 seconds
    after the bag file finishes.

    This makes it unusable in case we want to push the rqt_gui into a namespace.


    With the stand alone robot_monitor this could be circumvented by remapping
    the topic to a namespaced version of itself, e.g.
    /diagnostics_agg:=/rh/diagnostics_agg

    But this is not possible with rqt_gui, as it filters out the remapping
