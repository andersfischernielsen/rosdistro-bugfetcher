  title: Add kinetic and lunar and simplify CI
  body: "- Remove cruft from CI configuration\r\n- Add ROS kinetic to CI configuration\r\n- Add ROS lunar to CI configuration\r\n- Remove shadow-fixed builds from CI configuration. Since this repository has very few catkin dependencies, there's no reason to build for both shadow-fixed and released."

  title: Saving to bag vs text has different behavior.
  body: >
    Saving to a text file only includes the messages from the current view while
    saving to a bag file includes all logs in the database.  It is confusing to
    a user that the output format would lead to different content.

  title: Fix handling of log messages with multiple lines
  body: >
    The console is doing a really bad job when log messages have multiple
    lines.  They are either cut off to only show the top line, or every other
    log item is expanded to have the same height, leaving a ton of white space
    and making the log difficult to read, depending on what row the list view
    uses to determine the row height.  


    Part of the problem is that the list view is set to use a uniform row
    height.  Without uniform height, the view is basically unusable on systems
    with a lot of traffic.  I think the right way forward is either to find a
    different optimization, or to split log messages with multiple lines into
    multiple rows.  The second seems preferable, but we'd ideally do it in a way
    that works well with searching and copying.

  title: Ctrl+a while node list has focus no longer selects all nodes
  body: >
    Pressing ctrl+a while the node list has focused used to select all the
    nodes.  This behavior was broken around the time clipboard support was
    added, and now ctrl+a seems to always select all the messages even if the
    node list has focus.

  title: Nodes reappear in node list after clear node list button was pressed.
  body: >
    If you press the "Clear Node List" button, the nodes disappear from the list
    but will reappear the next time a message is received.

  title: Save & restore user settings
  body: >
    As swri_console becomes more powerful and more customizable, it would make
    sense to save user settings and load them on startup so that users don't
    have to re-set everything every time it loads. The QSettings class provides
    a handy, platform-independent way of saving settings.


    Things that should probably be saved:

    Show Timestamps

    Absolute Timestamps

    Use regular expressions

    Include filter

    Exclude filter

    Severity display selection

    Follow Newest Messages

    Font

    There are other features that haven't been implemented yet (such as
    colorizing log messages) that should be saved, too.
