  title: 'Revert "Added panda to moveit resources (#19)"'
  body: "@davetcoleman As you moved `panda_moveit_config` into its own repo, https://github.com/ros-planning/panda_moveit_config, we should remove it from `moveit_resources`. \r\nHowever, it is already used in one unit test (MSA). **Needs to be checked, whether this can be replaced by fanuc or pr2.** Maybe, there are some references in the tutorials as well?\r\nHowever, it definitely doesn't make sense to maintain these packages in two separate repos.\r\nI propose to `run_depend` `moveit_resources` from `panda_moveit_config` and `franka_description`, which will pull in those packages together with `moveit_resources`.\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit 5c71455fb7c0164597eeb8301b04f223c12add00."

  title: 'Add missing run depends for [robot|joint]_state_publisher'
  body: >
    In https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/pull/214 I switched our CI to
    build off of `ros-base` instead of `ros-desktop-full`. This means many ROS
    packages are not installed by default, which uncovered missing dependencies
    in the python move_group test causing travis to
    [fail](https://travis-ci.org/ros-planning/moveit/jobs/159809406):


    ```

    FAILURE: Test Fixture Nodes ['joint_state_publisher',
    'robot_state_publisher'] failed to launch
