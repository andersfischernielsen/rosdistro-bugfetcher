  title: Remove fluid from run_depends (1/3)
  body: >
    In Ubuntu, `libfltk-dev` has a dependency on `fluid`. In Fedora, it does
    not, and without it the build fails like so:


    ```

    CMake Error at
    /usr/share/cmake/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:136 (message):
      Could NOT find FLTK (missing: FLTK_FLUID_EXECUTABLE)
    Call Stack (most recent call first):
      /usr/share/cmake/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:343 (_FPHSA_FAILURE_MESSAGE)
      /usr/share/cmake/Modules/FindFLTK.cmake:320 (FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS)
      CMakeLists.txt:105 (find_package)


    -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

    ```


    This breaks all Fedora builds (Indigo/Jade, Fedora 20/21/22)
