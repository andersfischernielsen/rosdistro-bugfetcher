  title: Purpose of this package
  body: "I'm curious to the purpose of this package. I just encountered this a a dependency for `rqt_web`. Don't we have rosdep to find the right system dependencies for a given platform + ros distro?\r\n\r\nWhy should there be a package which in practise does nothing more than delegate to a rosdep key?"
