  title: CMake find_package does not specify OpenCV version
  body: "cv_camera depends on OpenCV2, however the find_package-call in the CMakeLists.txt will first discover OpenCV3 if both are installed. To circumvent this, the call should be changed to:\r\n```\r\nfind_package(OpenCV 2 REQUIRED)\r\n```\r\n(see http://wiki.ros.org/vision_opencv)"
