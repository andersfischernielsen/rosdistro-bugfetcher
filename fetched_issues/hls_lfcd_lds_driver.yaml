  title: Corrected max-range to avoid fencepost error.
  body: >-
    The issue here is that in a laser scan the angle_min should refer to the
    direction of the first beam and angle_max to the direction of the last beam
    in the scan. If you assume 0 ~ 2pi, the first beam is counted twice,
    resulting in 361 beams that should be in the scan.
