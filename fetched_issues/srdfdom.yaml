  title: Do we want srdfdom to be standalone (no-ROS) package?
  body: >
    Looking at
    [package.xml](https://github.com/ros-planning/srdfdom/blob/a1dd5324cf15117fd6818f4c3e9d6b3ea2f7f7a0/package.xml),
    it looks like `srdfdom` is not and has not been depending on ROS, but
    searching the code lets me spot [a
    line](https://github.com/ros-planning/srdfdom/blob/503a8948162c7958ad2719c9e3bba19877ef0115/src/srdfdom/srdf.py#L220)
    in a method that depends on `rospy`, and the method is used by
    `scripts/display_srdf`.


    I can't think of much benefit wrt to the effort of making it standlone,
    since `srdf` is primarily used only in MoveIt! (correct if wrong) and
    MoveIt! is ROS-based.

  title: SRDF Python parser
  body: >
    Dear developers, 


    I needed a SRDF python parser, to loop over the groups and joints and such
    (this is useful to generate new moveit config files from existing ones)

    I could not find an existing SRDF python parser, so the fastest and easiest
    solution was to derive from urdf_parser_py and and depend on its
    xml_reflection lib. 

    The parser can be found there https://github.com/ubi-agni/srdf_parser_py 

    It also integrates a full srdf parsing test


    Would it make sense to create a srdfdom_py similar to urdfdom_py integrating
    such a parser ?

  title: release indigo 0.2.7
  body: >
    I've created an indigo-devel branch with the correct dependencies on
    console_bridge and urdfdom_headers for Saucy and Trusty. RE:
    https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/issues/4633


    This needs to be released into indigo.
