  title: Added gennodejs message generation
  body: >
    This adds the dependency of `gennodejs` to message generation to force the
    buildfarm. I am not sure this is strictly necessary, as `catkin_make` and
    `catkin_make install` run in a developer's workspace will both generate and
    deploy the messages as expected (without needing to explicitly patch
    `message_generation`).

    However, as of last night's build, `shadow-fixed` had the `gennodejs`
    package in it, but did not generate any messages. Is there any way to test
    that this change to `message_generation` will have the desired effect of
    rebuilding all ROS messages for Javascript?

  title: add depeus dependency
  body: >
    I'd like to add geneus dependency, currently it is within jsk_roseus
    repository but may be we have to create isolated repository that only
    includes genesu. This packages only depends on python.

    https://github.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_roseus/tree/master/geneus


    I understand there are already genlisp exists, but our geneus is lisp
    message generator for our implementation of lisp. So they are different.
    Having multiple implementation is a kind of Lisp tradition.

  title: A genjava dependency
  body: >
    Feasability of an official genjava generator - the main worry would be
    introducing a large dependency on openjdk or some such since the generator
    needs to compile java class files into a jar.


    This could be a build_depend only though.


    Are there any issues/worries with this?
