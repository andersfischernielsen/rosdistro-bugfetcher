  title: Indigo Desktop has regressed on armhf due to an injected gazebo dependency
  body: "urdf_tutorials now depends on gazebo_ros which depends on gazebo which is not available on indigo armhf. And the simulator is not supposed to be part of desktop. \r\n\r\n@sloretz Is this related to the urdf repo restructuring?\r\n\r\n@ros/ros_team FYI"

  title: Remove superfluous dependencies (already in viz)
  body: >
    The ros-desktop metapackage now only contains tutorials and roslint (which
    should probably go somewhere like core or base). So in principal we could
    rename this to ros-tutorials and ros-desktop-full to ros-desktop, but that's
    probably to late in the game...

  title: Add robot_state_publisher to robot metapackage
  body: >
    In groovy, robot_model included robot_state_publisher as a run_depend, but
    it has been broken out to a separate repository in hydro. Currently, no
    hydro metapackage includes robot_state_publisher, a key component to pretty
    much all robots.
