  title: Release rosauth for Lunar
  body: >-
    Could you release rosauth for Lunar? I've tested that it works and that that
    debian packages built. I'm trying to release the rospilot package for Lunar,
    which depends on this. Thanks!

  title: Added gencpp-dependency for test target
  body: >
    This commit fixes a 'missing rosauth.h' error during compilation of the test
    for me. If this is not the appropriate solution, I'd be happy to learn what
    the real problem is.

  title: Missing build-dependency
  body: >
    I ran into some issues compiling the rosauth package. The include file
    "rosauth.h" is missing during compilation, which can be fixed by restarting
    catkin_make 3 - 4 times in a row.  

    Adding explicit dependencies on gencpp for the test target fixes this issue
    for me.

    Please see #8 for further details

  title: missing libssl-dev during build
  body: >
    I'm opening this issue here because it is where I discovered it, but it
    requires a little bit of input from one of the core developers. I believe an
    update to the wiki is in order to clarify this in the future.


    The test at
    (https://github.com/WPI-RAIL/rosauth/blob/develop/CMakeLists.txt#L62) uses a
    header file from `libssl-dev`, and this is not listed in the `package.xml`.
    Since this file is only compiled for testing, should it be listed as a
    `build_depend` or a `test_depend`?


    If it indeed should be listed as a `test_depend`, I believe an update to
    https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/bloom is in order, as it currently
    does not add `test_depend`s to the build requirements for packages.


    This is not currently blocking builds on the ubuntu buildfarm because
    `libssl-dev` is being installed for some (other) reason. On Fedora, I've
    found that this is not necessarily true, and that we need to list it
    somewhere here. The question is where...


    Looking for input from @tfoote, @wjwwood and/or @dirk-thomas on whether the
    build-time test dependency should be a `build_depend` or a `test_depend`.
    Please update the wiki to reflect this.


    Thanks!
