  title: How to extract Magnetic data independently?
  body: "Hi All!\r\n\r\nRecently I'm using **3DM-GX3-25 IMU** on the Husky robot and got the rostopic `/imu/data`. However, what I need is **only the Magnetic data** measured by the IMU. \r\n\r\nI checked on my Husky robot and found that it used the driver **microstrain_3dmgx2_imu**. Then I checked the ros-drivers and it seems that gyroscope data, accelerometer data and magnetic data are fused and output together as `/imu/data`. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo I'm wondering is there any way to modify the driver to **only extract the Magnetic data** (output as a rostopic like `/imu/magnetic`)?\r\nAny advice or hint is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n@chadrockey @mmwise @kwc @gerkey \r\n"

  title: Missing explicit dependency and include on log4cxx
  body: >
    In the latest version of rosconsole the strict dependency on log4cxx has
    been removed. Now your package `microstrain_3dmgx2_imu` fails to build since
    it relied on the transitive dependency.


    Please make the dependency on log4cxx explicit and import the necessary
    header file to unbreak the build on the farm
    (http://jenkins.ros.org/view/HbinP32/job/ros-hydro-microstrain-3dmgx2-imu_binarydeb_precise_i386).
