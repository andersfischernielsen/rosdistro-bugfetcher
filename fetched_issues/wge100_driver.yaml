    Need to check whether this is still the case, and if so figure out why.
    Probably only worth doing on the new firmware, so passing on to James.

    Description:


    Currently this is only seen with debugging on. Very misleading...


    `[DEBUG] [1284765338.042548750]: TriggerMatcher did not get timestamp for
    frame #24`

    This message needs to be prioritized without resulting in spewage.
