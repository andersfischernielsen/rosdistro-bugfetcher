  title: Add missing dependency on pluginlib
  body: >
    Nodelet does not pass along pluginlib implicitly, because pluginlib is not
    used in any exposed headers.  This is correct behavior on nodelet's behalf.


    This library directly imports pluginlib:


    https://github.com/ros-perception/laser_proc/blob/groovy-devel/src/LaserProcNodelet.cpp#L59


    And therefore this package should depend on pluginlib explicitly.
