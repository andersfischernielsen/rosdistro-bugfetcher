  title: Axes mixed up?
  body: "I just tested pose view with a sequence of simple rotations, and the box in the visualization appears to rotate the correct amount around the correct axis, but in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nThese are the rotations I tried and the results I got:\r\n\r\n| roll | pitch | yaw  |  q.x |  q.y |  q.z |  q.w | result     | expectation |\r\n|------|-------|------|------|------|------|------|------------|-------------|\r\n| 15°  | 0     | 0    | .13  | 0    | 0    | .99  | neg. roll  | pos. roll   |\r\n| 0    | 15°   | 0    | 0    | .13  | 0    | .99  | neg. pitch | pos. pitch  |\r\n| 0    | 0     | 15°  | 0    | 0    | .13  | .99  | neg. yaw   | pos. yaw    |\r\n| -15° | 0     | 0    | -.13 | 0    | 0    | .99  | pos. roll  | neg. roll   |\r\n| 0    | -15°  | 0    | 0    | -.13 | 0    | .99  | pos. pitch | neg. pitch  |\r\n| 0    | 0     | -15° | 0    | 0    | -.13 | .99  | pos. yaw   | neg. yaw    |\r\n\r\nI'm assuming that the colors in pose view are (red = x), (green = y), (blue = z), and that it uses right-handed rotations. Is that correct?\r\n\r\n(I used http://www.andre-gaschler.com/rotationconverter/ to calculate quaternions to test based on roll/pitch/yaw values. Since the rotations are simple, Euler angle convention should not matter, but I had it set to ZYX.)"
