  title: Require at least Boost 1.47
  body: >
    I realise `indigo-devel` implies certain minimum versions of dependencies,
    but I always prefer making things explicit.


    Proposed change makes the configuration phase error out if Boost is not >=
    1.47.0, which is required by the eip library code (according to
    [boost/asio/doc/history.qbk](https://github.com/boostorg/asio/blob/ccb7292b2d48803f8f47f709b5758219fef12715/doc/history.qbk#L434-L435),
    `asio::buffer_copy(..)` was introduced in 1.47.0).
