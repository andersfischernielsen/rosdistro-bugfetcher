    [Bug] Loading params from yaml via roslaunch and <rosparam> not consistent
    with roscore
  body: "Hi folks,\r\n\r\nlooks like I have found another bug. I have a YAML file that looks like this:\r\n\r\n    joints: \r\n      - (JointA, 0)\r\n      - (JointB, 1)\r\n      - (JointC, 16)\r\n\r\n...basically. \r\n\r\nWhen I load this YAML file in a launch file by means of `<rosparam command=\"load\" file=\"...` and fetch the parameters afterwards with `rosparam get joints` I get the following returned from `roscore`: \r\n\r\n    ['(JointA, 0)', '(JointB, 1)', '(JointC, 16)']\r\n\r\n... which obviously is a list.\r\n\r\nBut when I try to do that with `vapor_master` I get the following:\r\n\r\n    {'0': '(JointA, 0)', '1': '(JointB, 1)', '2': '(JointC, 16)'}\r\n\r\n... which undoubtedly is a dictionary. \r\n\r\nIn order to use `vapor_master` as a true drop-in replacement, these things must be consistent.

  title: duplicate node names should not be allowed
  body: >-
    roscore calls `shutdown` on the first node when duplicate node names are
    detected. roscore first shutdown first node then replaces records with
    second node's annoucements
